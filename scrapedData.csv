The Secret History of Gun Rights: How Lawmakers Armed the N.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/nra-congress-firearms.html,"Long before the National Rifle Association tightened its grip on Congress, won over the Supreme Court and prescribed more guns as a solution to gun violence — before all that, Representative John D. Dingell Jr. had a plan.

First jotted on a yellow legal pad in 1975, it would transform the N.R.A. from a fusty club of sportsmen into a lobbying juggernaut that would enforce elected officials’ allegiance, derail legislation behind the scenes, redefine the legal landscape and deploy “all available resources at every level to influence the decision making process.”

“An organization with as many members, and as many potential resources, both financial and influential within its ranks, should not have to go 2d or 3d Class in a fight for survival,” Mr. Dingell wrote, advocating a new aggressive strategy. “It should go First Class.”

To understand the ascendancy of gun culture in America, the files of Mr. Dingell, a powerful Michigan Democrat who died in 2019, are a good place to start. That is because he was not just a politician — he simultaneously sat on the N.R.A.’s board of directors, positioning him to influence firearms policy as well as the private lobbying force responsible for shaping it.",0.2047979797979798,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/multimedia/00nra-files-cgbv/00nra-files-cgbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['rifle', 'congress', 'supreme court', 'gun violence —', 'john d. dingell jr.', 'n.r.a', 'fusty club', 'officials ’ allegiance', 'derail legislation', 'legal landscape', 'deploy “', 'available resources', 'decision making process. ” “', 'potential resources', '3d class', 'mr. dingell', 'new aggressive strategy', 'class.', 'gun culture', 'america', 'mr. dingell', 'michigan democrat', 'good place', 'politician —', 'n.r.a.', '’ s board', 'firearms policy']","[('the National Rifle Association', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('the Supreme Court', 'ORG'), ('John D.

The Legacy Dilemma: What to Do About Privileges for the Privileged?,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/legacy-admissions-college-alumni.html,"Like Ms. James-Chakraborty, students and alumni of many colleges and universities — not just ultra-elite ones — are now wrestling with the practice of legacy admissions, a debate with far broader implications after the Supreme Court last month gutted race-based admissions programs and forced colleges to reconsider their criteria for accepting students.

It has sparked some bracing introspection and complicated feelings.

About the role familial connections played in the success of many alumni. About whether the practice of legacy admissions, which has long favored white families, should be eliminated just as a more diverse generation of graduates is getting ready to send its own children to college. About how to reconcile the belief that privileges for the privileged are wrong with the parental impulse to do whatever they can for their own children.

With the end of race-based affirmative action, the practice of giving admissions preference to relatives of alumni is particularly under fire at the most elite institutions, given the outsized presence of their alumni in the nation’s highest echelons of power. A new analysis of data from elite colleges published last week underscored how legacy admissions have effectively served as affirmative action for the privileged. Children of alumni, who are more likely to come from rich families, were nearly four times as likely to be admitted as other applicants with the same test scores.",0.2065493646138807,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/multimedia/30nat-legacies-03-bjpw/30nat-legacies-03-bjpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['ms. james-chakraborty', 'universities —', 'ultra-elite ones —', 'legacy admissions', 'broader implications', 'supreme court', 'admissions programs', 'role familial connections', 'legacy admissions', 'white families', 'diverse generation', 'own children', 'parental impulse', 'own children', 'affirmative action', 'admissions preference', 'elite institutions', 'nation ’ s', 'new analysis', 'elite colleges', 'legacy admissions', 'affirmative action', 'rich families', 'test scores']","[('James-Chakraborty', 'PERSON'), ('the Supreme Court', 'ORG'), ('last month', 'DATE'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('nearly four', 'CARDINAL')]",Politics
A Left-Right Alliance Puts Iowa’s CO2 Pipelines on the Presidential Agenda,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/iowa-pipelines-trump.html,"The $4.5 billion Summit, $3 billion Navigator and $630 million Wolf Carbon pipelines may not be front and center next month at the first Republican presidential debate. They probably won’t be featured in super PAC advertising or mentioned during Fox News appearances. But the pipelines capture a national debate with local consequences, and they will give candidates a chance to showcase their understanding of Iowa, the first state to weigh in on the Republican nominating fight — if they can navigate the issue.

The Summit, Navigator and Wolf pipelines, fueled by federal tax credits embraced by both parties, would draw carbon dioxide from the factories that turn Iowa corn into ethanol. They would snake through 3,300 miles of farmland in Iowa and other Midwestern states, then pump the planet-warming gas into the bedrock beneath Illinois and North Dakota. And they are pitched as a climate protection measure, though some experts and environmentalists say it is only a partial solution at best.

Earlier this month, an Iowa woman seemed to stump the front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, when she asked how he would “help us in Iowa save our farmland from the CO2 pipelines.”

Mr. Trump stammered that he was “working on that” and that he “had a plan to totally, uh, it’s such a ridiculous situation,” before reassuring the crowd, “if we win, that’s going to be taken care of.”",0.13166666666666668,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/us/politics/26pol-pipeline-new1/26pol-pipeline-new1-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['summit', 'navigator', 'wolf carbon', 'republican', 'presidential debate', '’ t', 'pac', 'fox', 'news appearances', 'national debate', 'local consequences', 'iowa', 'republican', 'fight —', 'summit', 'navigator', 'wolf', 'federal tax credits', 'carbon dioxide', 'iowa', 'iowa', 'midwestern', 'illinois', 'dakota', 'climate protection measure', 'partial solution', 'iowa', 'donald j. trump', 'iowa', 'co2', 'pipelines. ”', 'mr. trump', '’ s', 'ridiculous situation', '’ s']","[('$4.5 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$3 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$630 million', 'MONEY'), ('Wolf Carbon', 'PERSON'), ('next month', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Republican', 'NORP'), ('Fox News', 'ORG'), ('Iowa', 'GPE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Republican', 'NORP'), ('Navigator', 'ORG'), ('Wolf', 'PERSON'), ('Iowa', 'GPE'), ('3,300 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('Iowa', 'GPE'), ('Midwestern', 'NORP'), ('Illinois', 'GPE'), ('North Dakota', 'GPE'), ('Earlier this month', 'DATE'), ('Iowa', 'GPE'), ('Donald J.

Nuts-and-Bolts Conservatism From Nikki Haley,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/nikki-haley-stump-speech.html,"“Instead of 87,000 I.R.S. agents, we’ll put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground, and we will let them do their job.”

The promise — and its reception — underscore the fixation of the Republican base with the nation’s Southwestern border. She also echoes misleading claims from Republican lawmakers that Democrats are seeking to hire an army of tax auditors under the Internal Revenue Service to scrutinize the financial filings of middle-class families. Like many of the other Republican candidates, Ms. Haley sides with Mr. Trump on border and immigration policy, pledging to build a wall, defund sanctuary cities and bring back a Trump-era program requiring asylum seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico. “Because guess what? Nobody wants to remain in Mexico,” she adds, sometimes garnering laughs.

“We will make sure that every member of Congress has to get their health care through the V.A. You watch how fast it gets fixed.”

Perhaps no other line in Ms. Haley’s stump speech draws a more passionate response from audiences than this one. She has pledged to tackle veteran homelessness and high suicide rates and to improve veterans’ access to health care. The issues are personal for Ms. Haley, whose husband, Michael, is a major in the South Carolina Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan in 2013. This summer, Ms. Haley joined other military spouses in seeing their partners off, as they deployed to Africa with the Army National Guard. The military tour is expected to last a year and for most of the G.O.P. primary race.

“Don’t you think it’s time we have term limits in Congress? We have to do it. We have to have term limits in Congress, and I think we need to have mental health competency tests for anyone over the age of 75.”

Ms. Haley, who has couched her campaign message in a call for “a new generation of leaders,” long sought to distinguish herself from competitors by taking an early stance on the issue of age limits among political leaders. Her shots are most directly aimed at President Biden, 80, whose age is cited as a top concern, as he seeks re-election. In an interview with Fox News, she suggested that Mr. Biden, would not live until the end of his second term if re-elected. On the stump, she often suggests that a vote for Mr. Biden is a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

“No more gender pronoun classes in the military. It is demoralizing to make them do that.”

Ms. Haley has faced blowback from Democrats, women’s rights groups and transgender rights activists for proposing that transgender girls playing in school sports is the “women’s issue of our time,” and for appearing to suggest that allowing “biological boys” in girls’ locker rooms was connected with the high rate of teenage girls who have considered suicide. She has since modified her statements so as not to link the two separate issues, but she has not dropped her focus on gender issues and implications that women are being erased. “Johns Hopkins recently came out and defined what a woman was,” she said in Hollis, referring to the research university. “Did you see it? A ‘nonman.’”",0.06956876456876457,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/multimedia/30pol-haley-fbvj/30pol-haley-fbvj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['i.r.s', '’ ll', 'border patrol', 'ice', 'job. ”', 'reception — underscore', 'republican', 'nation ’ s', 'southwestern border', 'republican', 'tax auditors', 'internal', 'revenue service', 'financial filings', 'middle-class families', 'republican', 'ms. haley', 'mr. trump', 'immigration policy', 'defund sanctuary cities', 'trump-era', 'asylum seekers', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'congress', 'health care', 'v.a', 'fixed. ”', 'ms. haley', '’ s stump speech draws', 'passionate response', 'veteran homelessness', 'high suicide rates', 'veterans ’ access', 'health care', 'ms. haley', 'michael', 'carolina', 'national guard', 'afghanistan', 'ms. haley', 'military spouses', 'africa', 'national guard', 'military tour', 'g.o.p', 'primary race', 'don', '’ t', '’ s time', 'term limits', 'congress', 'term limits', 'congress', 'mental health competency tests', '75. ”', 'ms. haley', 'campaign message', 'new generation', 'early stance', 'age limits', 'political leaders', 'biden', 'top concern', 'fox', 'mr. biden', 'mr. biden', 'vice president', 'kamala harris', 'gender pronoun classes', 'that. ”', 'ms. haley', 'women ’ s rights groups', 'transgender rights activists', 'transgender girls', 'school sports', '“ women ’ s issue', '“ biological boys ”', 'girls ’ locker rooms', 'high rate', 'teenage girls', 'separate issues', 'gender issues', 'hopkins', 'hollis', 'research university', '‘ nonman', '’ ”']","[('87,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('I.R.S.', 'GPE'), ('25,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Republican', 'NORP'), ('Southwestern', 'NORP'), ('Republican', 'NORP'), ('Democrats', 'NORP'), ('the Internal Revenue Service', 'ORG'), ('Republican', 'NORP'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Trump', 'ORG'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Michael', 'PERSON'), ('the South Carolina Army National Guard', 'ORG'), ('Afghanistan', 'GPE'), ('2013', 'DATE'), ('This summer', 'DATE'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Africa', 'LOC'), ('the Army National Guard', 'ORG'), ('last a year', 'DATE'), ('G.O.P.', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('the age of 75', 'DATE'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('80', 'DATE'), ('Fox News', 'ORG'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('Kamala Harris', 'PERSON'), ('Haley', 'PERSON'), ('Democrats', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Johns Hopkins', 'ORG'), ('Hollis', 'GPE')]",Politics
Trump Team Creates Legal-Defense Fund to Cover His Allies’ Bills,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/trump-legal-defense-fund.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump’s team is creating a legal-defense fund to handle some of the crush of legal bills stemming from the investigations and criminal indictments involving him and a number of employees and associates, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

The fund, which is expected to be called the Patriot Legal Defense Fund Inc., will be led by Michael Glassner, a longtime Trump political adviser, according to the people familiar with the planning, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Another Trump aide who worked at the Trump Organization and then in Mr. Trump’s administration, Lynne Patton, will also be involved, the people said.

It is unclear how broad a group of people the legal-defense fund will cover, but one person said it was not expected to cover Mr. Trump’s own legal bills. In recent months Mr. Trump’s political action committee has paid legal bills for him and several witnesses, spending over $40 million on lawyers in the first half of 2023.

Minor Characters Emerge to Play Key Roles in Trump Documents Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/us/politics/trump-documents-de-oliveira-nauta.html,"Much of the story involves what prosecutors have said was a plot to move boxes of documents in and out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago to avoid returning them to the government. Prosecutors say there was also a subsequent attempt to disguise those movements by seeking to delete footage from security cameras positioned outside the storage room.

According to the indictment, Mr. Nauta was central to the first part of the scheme, moving boxes from the room at least five times at Mr. Trump’s direction. All of that took place during a critical moment in the government’s investigation: the weeks between the issuance of a subpoena last year demanding the return of all classified documents in Mr. Trump’s possession and a visit to Mar-a-Lago shortly after by prosecutors seeking to collect the materials.

Mr. Nauta’s path to Mr. Trump and Mar-a-Lago was also characterized by a degree of turbulence.

A member of the Navy, Mr. Nauta had worked as a valet for Mr. Trump in the White House. But toward the end of his military career, Navy officials removed him from what is known as the Presidential Support Detail after learning he had fraternized with colleagues and subordinates in the White House mess, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

As naval officials were deciding what to do — including the possibility of sending Mr. Nauta back out to sea on a ship — an aide to Mr. Trump, who was already out of office, reached out to Mr. Nauta, offering him a job at Mar-a-Lago as the former president’s personal aide, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Nauta leaped at the opportunity, the person said, taking the job in July 2021 after receiving an honorable discharge from the Navy.

Judge Dismisses Trump’s $475 Million Defamation Suit Against CNN,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/business/media/trump-cnn-lawsuit.html,"A federal judge has dismissed a $475 million defamation lawsuit that former President Donald J. Trump filed against CNN, ruling that all of the CNN statements that Mr. Trump cited were opinion and, therefore, Mr. Trump could not sue for defamation.

The suit, which the former president filed in October in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., alleged a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that, Mr. Trump asserted, had escalated “as CNN fears the plaintiff will run for president in 2024.” The lawsuit said that the network’s use of the phrase “the big lie” in reference to Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election was tantamount to comparing him to Adolf Hitler and Nazism.

Judge Raag Singhal, who was nominated to the District Court by Mr. Trump in 2019, stated in dismissing the suit late Friday night that CNN’s use of the phrase in connection with Mr. Trump’s election challenges “does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people.”

The judge added: “The Court finds Nazi references in the political discourse (made by whichever ‘side’) to be odious and repugnant.

Trump Threatens Republicans Who Don’t Help Him Exact Vengeance,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/trump-pennsylvania-rally.html,"Former President Donald J.

In a litany of grievances about his deepening legal woes and the direction of the country, the twice-indicted former president cast G.O.P. holdouts as meek during a rally in Erie, Pa., criticizing their response to what he described as politically motivated prosecutions against him.

“The Republicans are very high class,” he said. “You’ve got to get a little bit lower class.”

Biden Presses Ahead With Effort to Broker Israeli-Saudi Rapprochement,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/biden-israel-saudi-arabia-negotiations.html,"Saudi demands for normalization with Israel have been expansive. Among other things, Saudi officials want a NATO-level alliance with the United States in which an attack on one is an attack on all, long a taboo among American policymakers who do not want to be committed to coming to the defense of a nondemocratic monarchy in case of war. And they want a civilian nuclear program despite longstanding opposition by Israel and the United States, which fear a nuclear arms race in the region.

Israeli officials who recently met with American counterparts were given the impression that while the first phase of the negotiations did not include any demand for significant Israeli concessions in their conflict with the Palestinians, it is now believed that a deal would require significant progress on the issue.

Israeli officials were told that King Salman, who has ceded much control to his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, intervened in the negotiations to insist any deal include a clear Israeli move toward the Palestinians, according to an Israeli defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

The Saudis, according to the Israeli impression, would not be satisfied with a promise by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to annex the West Bank, something that is not even envisioned by the current government. Instead, they would demand significant action on the ground.

It is highly doubtful whether significant concessions to the Palestinians would be approved by the current right-wing Israeli coalition, and an internal push for such a proposal could dissolve the government.

Even as Mr. Trump has been hit with two criminal indictments, with more possibly coming, he has only consolidated support in recent months, flashing the same resilience in Iowa that he has nationally.

Mr. Trump’s rivals have long circled Iowa as the early state where Mr. Trump, who finished a disappointing second in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, might be most vulnerable in 2024.

Rep. Dean Phillips Says He Is Considering a Run Against Biden,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/dean-phillips-biden-2024.html,"Representative Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat who has for months been saying in public what many in his party only whisper in private — that the 80-year-old President Biden should not seek re-election because of his age — said he was considering challenging Mr. Biden in next year’s primary.

Mr. Phillips, 54, is in his third term in Congress representing a district that includes the suburbs west of Minneapolis. In a text message, he confirmed his interest in running but declined a request to be interviewed. He said he had “been overwhelmed with outreach and encouragement” and needed to assess his next steps.

Mr. Phillips would be an extreme long shot if he were to challenge Mr. Biden. Polls show that Democrats, who were once wary about Mr. Biden seeking re-election, have coalesced behind him. The party’s major donor class is backing the president, who raised $72 million with the Democratic National Committee and his joint fund-raising committee during the three-month reporting period that ended June 30.

Mr. Phillips had $277,000 in his congressional fund-raising account at the end of June.

An heir to a Minnesota liquor fortune who showcased himself driving a gelato truck in his first House campaign, Mr. Phillips has been known in Congress for embracing the moderate suburban politics that were at the core of the general election coalition that propelled Mr. Biden’s 2020 victory. He was first elected in 2018, when he and dozens of fellow Democrats flipped Republican-held districts as suburban voters turned against President Donald J.

U.S. Hunts Chinese Malware That Could Disrupt American Military Operations,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/china-malware-us-military-bases-taiwan.html,"The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence and national security officials.

The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People’s Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.

The malware, one congressional official said, was essentially “a ticking time bomb” that could give China the power to interrupt or slow American military deployments or resupply operations by cutting off power, water and communications to U.S. military bases. But its impact could be far broader, because that same infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.

The first public hints of the malware campaign began to emerge in late May, when Microsoft said it had detected mysterious computer code in telecommunications systems in Guam, the Pacific island with a vast American air base, and elsewhere in the United States.

"The Dave Matthews Band, Reconsidered",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/briefing/the-dave-matthews-band-reconsidered.html,"The Dave Matthews Band is on tour, as they have been every summer, except 2020, for the past 30-odd years. Like the Grateful Dead and Phish, so-called jam bands with which it’s often lumped together, Dave Matthews has a deliriously passionate fan base that follows the band from city to city, reuniting with fellow disciples at preshow tailgates, showing off devotional tattoos, trading live recordings.

In the early ’90s, when I arrived for my first year at the University of Virginia, Dave Matthews was a local celebrity. His band played for five bucks every Tuesday night at the little bar down the street from campus. I’m a little embarrassed to admit it, but I never went to see them.

It would be years before the stereotype of Dave Matthews fans as “pot-smoking, tie-dye-touting former frat bros fawning over craft beers in parking lots between cornhole games,” as Perri Ormont Blumberg puts it, would become a widely understood social designation. But for those of us figuring out how to reconcile the rise of grunge with our carefully curated Manic Panic-dyed identities, a college bar band with a fiddle player was way too mainstream.

“You’re sort of defined as much by what you dislike as by what you like at that age,” Ben Sisario, a music reporter at The Times and one of my first college friends, said recently. Ben and I met on our first night at Virginia. He was wearing a T-shirt from the 1992 tour of the alt-rock band the Pixies; our friendship was cemented in the uncomplicated way of teenagers for whom there’s little distinction between who you listen to and who you are.

For years, like so many children of aging parents across America, politicians and their advisers in Washington tried to skirt that difficult conversation, wrapping concerns about their octogenarian leaders in a cone of silence. The omertà was enabled by the traditions of a city that arms public figures with a battalion of aides, who manage nearly all of their professional and personal lives.

“I don’t know what the magic number is, but I do think that as a general rule, my goodness, when you get into the 80s, it’s time to think about a little relaxation,” said Trent Lott, 81, a former Senate majority leader who retired at the spry age of 67 to start his own lobbying firm. “The problem is, you get elected to a six-year term, you’re in pretty good shape, but four years later you may not be so good.”

Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, breached the 10-minute mark and had to deliver the final words of his speech to a dead microphone with the country song “Only in America” playing loudly over him.

Before he was cut off, Mr. Hutchinson, who is polling at around 1 percent, also took a shot at the front-runner, saying, “You will be voting in Iowa while multiple criminal cases are pending against former President Trump.”

As the race takes shape five months ahead of the crucial Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump is surging ahead of a fractured field of rivals who are largely reluctant to criticize him, cowed by his fiercely loyal base.

But Mr. Trump’s legal troubles could still provide an opening for one of his rivals. The former president has now been indicted twice, and major new charges were added to one of those cases on Thursday. He also is expected to face two additional criminal cases. So far, however, the charges against him have seemed to coalesce Republican voters around his candidacy At the dinner, Mr. Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer, most pointedly mentioned the charges, and he also contradicted Mr. Trump’s false assertion that he had won the 2020 election.

“One of the things we need in our elected leaders is for them to tell the truth, even if it’s unpopular,” Mr. Hurd said. “Donald Trump is not running to make America great again.

New Trump Charges Highlight Long-Running Questions About Obstruction,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/us/politics/trump-charges-obstruction.html,"“Demanding that evidence be destroyed is the most basic form of obstruction and is easy for a jury to understand,” said Mr. Goldstein, who is now a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm Cooley.

“It is more straightforwardly criminal than the obstructive acts we detailed in the Mueller report,” he said. “And if proven, it makes it easier to show that Trump had criminal intent for the rest of the conduct described in the indictment.”

The accusation about Mr. Trump’s desire to have evidence destroyed adds another chapter to what observers of his career say is a long pattern of gamesmanship on his part with prosecutors, regulators and others who have the ability to impose penalties on his conduct.

And it demonstrates how Mr. Trump viewed the conclusion of the Mueller investigation as a vindication of his behavior, which became increasingly emboldened — particularly in regards to the Justice Department — throughout the rest of his presidency, a pattern that appears to have continued despite having lost the protections of the office when he was defeated in the election.

A Theory of Childbirth’s Evolution May Not Be What You’re Expecting,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/science/childbirth-evolution-obstetrical-dilemma.html,"But a detailed review of the evidence, slated to be published soon in the journal Evolutionary Anthropology, threw cold water on the idea. In the review, Anna Warrener, a biological anthropologist at the University of Colorado Denver, argued that the evidence to date did not offer strong support for the obstetrical dilemma, and that scientists had not paid enough attention to possible alternatives. What’s more, the scientist said, the idea sends a pernicious message to women that pregnancy is inherently dangerous.

“It perpetuates a narrative of bodily incompetence,” Dr. Warrener said.

In graduate school, Dr. Warrener did not see any reason to doubt the obstetrical dilemma. For her dissertation, she investigated one of Dr. Washburn’s key assumptions — that women walk less efficiently than men do because their pelvis is wider for childbirth. But in 2015, after studying volunteers walking on treadmills, Dr. Warrener found that having a wider pelvis did not create a bigger demand for oxygen.

“The data came in, and I was like, Wait a minute — I may have gotten some of the story wrong,” she recalled.

Holly Dunsworth, a biological anthropologist now at the University of Rhode Island, also became disenchanted with the obstetrical dilemma when she took a close look at the evidence. “I was scandalized,” she said.

"Worms Revived After 46,000 Years Frozen in Siberian Permafrost",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/science/roundworm-nematodes-siberia-permafrost.html,"At a time when the mighty woolly mammoth roamed the Earth, some 46,000 years ago, a minuscule pair of roundworms became encased in the Siberian permafrost.

Millennia later, the worms, thawed out of the ice, would wriggle again, and demonstrate to scientists that life could be paused — almost indefinitely.

The discovery, published this week in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Genetics, offers new insight into how the worms, also known as nematodes, can survive in extreme conditions for extraordinarily long periods of time, in this case tens of thousands of years.

Titanium Clouds Engulf This Ultrahot Neptune-like Planet,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/science/space/titanium-clouds-exoplanet.html,"Astronomers have come across the shiniest planet ever found, a mere 265 light years from our solar system. But that’s hardly its only standout trait. Shrouded by thick metallic clouds, this world’s temperature reaches a blistering 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and it quite likely rains scorching-hot drops of titanium.

The find, named LTT 9779 b, was described in a paper published this month in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Nearly five times as big as Earth, it’s one of the few ultrahot, gaseous exoplanets of this size that scientists have discovered.

“This opens a new window into understanding these kinds of extreme, Neptune-like planets — maybe some of the rarest planets that exist,” said James Jenkins, an astronomer at Diego Portales University in Chile, describing this one as probably having “a nasty, harsh, dark environment.”

Initially detected in 2018 by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, scientists quickly realized that this planet was an oddball. Usually worlds with short orbital periods are either like hot Jupiters, more than 10 times the size of Earth, or are small rocky orbs whose atmospheres have been stripped away by stellar radiation.

A Pancaked Turtle Fossil’s 150-Million-Year-Old Tale,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/science/turtle-pancake-fossil.html,"Today it is Bavaria, a region of Germany. But in the Late Jurassic Period, it was a shallow tropical archipelago ringed with sponge reefs. The hyper-saline, oxygen-poor conditions of these waters prevented scavengers from disturbing the bodies of animals that died in the lagoons.

Some 150 million years later, that has been very good news for paleontologists, who for more than 100 years have pulled complete fossils of everything from fish to marine reptiles, pterosaurs and feathered dinosaurs like Archaeopteryx from the Solnhofen Limestone.

The area’s latest find is a beautifully preserved — if pancaked — turtle. Described in an article published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, the specimen represents an approach to marine life unlike that of any shelled reptile today.

NASA Seeks a Nuclear-Powered Rocket to Get to Mars in Half the Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/science/nasa-nuclear-rocket-darpa.html,"A Number That Sums It Up: 3 to 4 months to Mars

What if a spacecraft could get to Mars in half the time it currently takes?

Every 26 months or so, Mars and Earth are close enough for a shorter journey between the worlds. But even then it is a pretty long trip, lasting seven to nine months. For most of the time, the spacecraft is just coasting through space.

But if the spacecraft could continue accelerating through the first half of the journey and then start slowing down again, the travel time could be slashed. Current rocket engines, which typically rely on the combustion of a fuel like hydrogen or methane with oxygen, are not efficient enough to accomplish that; there is not enough room in the spacecraft to carry that much propellant.

But nuclear reactions, generating energy from the splitting of uranium atoms, are much more efficient.

The DRACO engine would consist of a nuclear reactor that would heat hydrogen from a chilly minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit to a toasty 4,400 degrees, with the hot gas shooting from a nozzle to generate thrust. Greater fuel efficiency could speed up journeys to Mars, reducing the amount of time astronauts spend exposed to the treacherous environment of deep space.

Nuclear propulsion could also have uses closer to home, which is why DARPA is investing in the project. The technology may allow rapid maneuvers of military satellites in orbit around Earth.

Background: Back to the future

Nuclear propulsion for space is not a new idea. In the 1950s and 1960s, Project Orion — financed by NASA, the Air Force and the Advanced Research Projects Agency — contemplated using the explosions of atomic bombs to accelerate spacecraft.

At the same time, NASA and other agencies also undertook Project Rover and Project NERVA, efforts that aimed to develop nuclear-thermal engines similar in concept to those now being pursued by the DRACO program. A series of 23 reactors were built and tested, but none were ever launched to space. Until the end of this program in 1973, NASA had contemplated using nuclear reactors to propel space probes to Jupiter, Saturn and beyond, as well as to provide power at a lunar base.

“The technical capabilities, including early safety protocols, remain viable today,” Tabitha Dodson, the DRACO project manager, said in a news briefing on Wednesday.

A key difference between NERVA and DRACO is that NERVA used weapons-grade uranium for its reactors, while DRACO will use a less-enriched form of uranium.

The reactor would not be turned on until it reached space, part of the precautions to minimize the possibility of a radioactive accident on Earth.

“DRACO has already done all of our preliminary analyses across the entire spectrum of possibilities for accidents and found that we’re all the way down in the low probability and all the way down in the teeny tiny amount of release,” Dr. Dodson said.

What Happens Next: A test flight in orbit

The DRACO development is to culminate with a flight test of the nuclear-thermal engine. The launch is currently scheduled for late 2026 or early 2027.

The demonstration spacecraft would most likely orbit at an altitude between 435 and 1,240 miles, Dr. Dodson said. That is high enough to ensure that it stays in orbit for more than 300 years, or long enough for radioactive elements in the reactor fuel to decay to safe levels, she said.",0.04019904931669637,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/science/26nuclear-rocket/26nuclear-rocket-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['number', 'sums', 'up', 'mars', 'mars', 'mars', 'earth', 'shorter journey', 'travel time', 'current', 'rocket engines', 'nuclear reactions', 'uranium atoms', 'draco', 'nuclear reactor', 'heat hydrogen', 'fahrenheit', 'hot gas shooting', 'generate thrust', 'fuel efficiency', 'mars', 'time astronauts', 'treacherous environment', 'deep space', 'nuclear', 'darpa', 'rapid maneuvers', 'military satellites', 'earth', 'background', 'nuclear', 'new idea', 'project orion', 'nasa', 'air force', 'advanced', 'projects', 'agency —', 'atomic bombs', 'accelerate spacecraft', 'nasa', 'project rover', 'project nerva', 'nuclear-thermal engines', 'draco', 'nasa', 'nuclear reactors', 'propel space probes', 'jupiter', 'saturn', 'lunar base', 'technical capabilities', 'early safety protocols', 'tabitha dodson', 'draco', 'project manager', 'key difference', 'nerva', 'draco', 'nerva', 'weapons-grade uranium', 'draco', 'radioactive accident', 'earth', 'draco', 'preliminary analyses', 'entire spectrum', '’ re', 'low probability', 'tiny amount', '” dr.', 'dodson', 'happens', 'test flight', 'draco', 'flight test', 'nuclear-thermal engine', 'demonstration spacecraft', 'likely orbit', 'dodson', 'radioactive elements', 'reactor fuel', 'safe levels']","[('3 to 4 months', 'DATE'), ('Mars', 'LOC'), ('Mars', 'LOC'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Every 26 months or so', 'DATE'), ('Mars', 'LOC'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('seven to nine months', 'DATE'), ('the first half', 'DATE'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('420 degrees', 'QUANTITY'), ('Fahrenheit', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('4,400 degrees', 'QUANTITY'), ('Mars', 'LOC'), ('DARPA', 'ORG'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('the 1950s and 1960s', 'DATE'), ('Project Orion', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('the Air Force', 'ORG'), ('the Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Project Rover', 'ORG'), ('Project NERVA', 'ORG'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('23', 'CARDINAL'), ('1973', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Jupiter', 'LOC'), ('Saturn', 'PERSON'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Tabitha Dodson', 'PERSON'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('NERVA', 'ORG'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('NERVA', 'ORG'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('Dodson', 'PERSON'), ('DRACO', 'ORG'), ('late 2026', 'DATE'), ('early 2027', 'DATE'), ('1,240 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('Dodson', 'PERSON'), ('more than 300 years', 'DATE')]",Science
When Ancient Eruptions Pumped Diamonds to Earth’s Surface,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/science/kimberlite-diamonds-volcano-eruptions.html,"While diamonds might look pretty perched atop a ring, the rocks they hail from venture to Earth’s surface in a journey that’s anything but glamorous. Millions of years ago, some of our planet’s strangest and most violent volcanic outbursts dredged from deep underground most of the diamonds mined today in the form of blue-tinged rocks called kimberlites.

Unlike the volcanoes that more commonly pop up near the thinner edges of continents, the eruptions that produced most kimberlites came through the thick, stable continental cores known as cratons. Kimberlite eruptions start near the cratonic roots, at least 75 miles underground, and race upward at tens of feet per second — a fiery fury driven by an abundance of carbon dioxide and water.

“It’s like rocket fuel,” said Thomas Gernon, a geologist at the University of Southampton in England who has long studied kimberlites. The turbulent flow punches a carrot-shaped pipe through the ground, ripping out chunks of deep subsurface rock, including some that are studded with diamonds.

But existing research still has a giant diamond-shaped hole: Why do kimberlites form?

A new study led by Dr. Gernon and published Wednesday in the journal Nature points to the ancient roots of these eruptions. He and his colleagues report that the breakup of ancient supercontinents like Pangaea and Rodinia caused deep disruptions in the flow of the mantle beneath Earth’s crust, setting off the blasts.",0.04646464646464646,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/science/26tb-diamond-eruptions-01/26tb-diamond-eruptions-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['earth', '’ s surface', '’ s', 'millions', 'planet ’ s strangest', 'violent volcanic outbursts', 'thinner edges', 'stable continental cores', 'kimberlite', 'cratonic roots', 'fiery fury', 'carbon dioxide', '’ s', 'rocket fuel', 'thomas gernon', 'southampton', 'england', 'turbulent flow punches', 'deep subsurface rock', 'kimberlites form', 'new study', 'gernon', 'nature', 'ancient roots', 'ancient supercontinents', 'pangaea', 'rodinia', 'deep disruptions', 'earth', '’ s crust']","[('Earth', 'LOC'), ('Millions of years ago', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('kimberlites', 'NORP'), ('kimberlites', 'NORP'), ('at least 75 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('tens of feet', 'QUANTITY'), ('Thomas Gernon', 'PERSON'), ('the University of Southampton', 'ORG'), ('England', 'GPE'), ('Gernon', 'PERSON'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('Nature', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Pangaea', 'GPE'), ('Rodinia', 'GPE'), ('Earth', 'LOC')]",Science
Scientist’s Deep Dive for Alien Life Leaves His Peers Dubious,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/science/avi-loeb-extraterrestrial-life.html,"Dr. Loeb also began studying the fireball catalog from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA. That led to the object that had been detected in 2014. From its direction and speed at impact — 28 miles per second — Dr. Loeb and Mr. Siraj concluded that the fireball had been moving too fast for something gravitationally bound to our sun. That meant, like Oumuamua, it must also have been interstellar.

They wrote a paper about the discovery in 2019. It was initially rejected by The Astrophysical Journal, but the same journal then accepted it for publication last November, several months after the U.S. Space Command announced in a memo circulated on Twitter that measurements of the fireball’s velocity were accurate enough to infer interstellar origin.

That appeal to authority isn’t enough, said Peter Brown, a meteor physicist at Western University in Ontario. It’s unknown how precise the U.S. Defense Department data is, which affects how likely it is that the object came from beyond.

According to the police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.

The e-bike industry is booming, but the summer of 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can go 70 miles an hour. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.

(This is known as “pedal assist.”) Age restrictions: None in most states, although some states, such as Oregon, do not permit the use of any class of e-bike by riders younger than 16.

Class 2: Maximum speed, 20 m.p.h.; the motor may provide power independently of the pedals. Age restrictions: none in most states. (These e-bikes in particular attract criticism because, by relying solely on the motor, they can achieve immediate bursts of speed.)

Class 3: Maximum speed, 28 m.p.h. — but only if the pedals and the motor are used simultaneously.

When Connecting With Birds Connects People,https://www.nytimes.com/article/when-connecting-with-birds-connects-people.html,"Whether or not you’re into birds, joining a birding group can change your life.

Last week, we looked at groups that birders can join to make the activity a community affair. Our challenge for beginners was to try bird-watching with at least one other person. We also asked if anyone had met friends — or even a spouse — through a birding activity. We didn’t expect so many answers in the affirmative.

“I’m not sure it was our very first date, as she claims,” Rick Wright from Bloomfield, N.J., said. “But it was very early on that I invited a woman to go to the swine effluent ponds with me to look for shorebirds. She said yes. We’ve been married 25 years.”

For Gordon Dayton in Connecticut, it was the reverse. He was not interested in birding when he met his wife of many years, but the activity was something that happened along the way. “Some of us come to birding through love of birds, some through love of bird-lovers,” Mr. Dayton said.

Not everyone is eager to make birding anything more than a solitary activity. “I’m not a joiner,” Margaret Poethig from Arlington, Va., said. But as a beginner, she knew that other birders could help improve her skills. “So I started by participating in a local citizen science project, joined a couple of local bird clubs, went on a few bird walks and volunteered at a couple of club events.” Now she sometimes meets people who post checklists on her local eBird hot spot.",0.1465,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/20/multimedia/12-events-birding-community-science-wvqt/12-events-birding-community-science-wvqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['whether', '’ re', 'community affair', 'friends —', 'spouse —', 'didn ’ t', '’ m', 'rick wright', 'bloomfield', 'n.j.', 'swine effluent ponds', '’ ve', 'years. ”', 'gordon dayton', 'connecticut', 'mr. dayton', 'solitary activity', '’ m', 'margaret poethig', 'arlington', 'va.', 'local citizen science project', 'local bird clubs', 'club events. ”', 'post checklists', 'local ebird', 'hot spot']","[('Last week', 'DATE'), ('at least one', 'CARDINAL'), ('our very first date', 'DATE'), ('Rick Wright', 'PERSON'), ('Bloomfield', 'GPE'), ('N.J.', 'GPE'), ('25 years', 'DATE'), ('Gordon Dayton', 'PERSON'), ('Connecticut', 'GPE'), ('Dayton', 'PERSON'), ('Margaret Poethig', 'PERSON'), ('Arlington', 'GPE'), ('Va.', 'GPE'), ('eBird', 'PRODUCT')]",Science

A Bottleneck on the Grid Threatens Clean Energy. New Rules Aim to Help.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/climate/electric-grid-ferc-bottleneck.html,"Federal regulators on Thursday approved new rules to speed up the process for connecting wind and solar projects to the electric grid, in an attempt to reduce the growing delays that have become one of the biggest obstacles to building renewable energy in the United States.

Energy companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in wind farms, solar arrays and batteries, spurred on by federal tax breaks and falling costs. But these projects face a severe bottleneck: It is getting harder and taking longer to connect new power plants to the power lines that carry electricity to homes and businesses.

More than 10,000 energy projects — mostly wind, solar and batteries — were seeking permission to connect to electric grids at the end of 2022, up from 5,600 two years earlier. Grid operators have become overwhelmed by the volume. It now takes five years for the typical power plant to get approval, twice what it did a decade ago, and developers say the process has become dysfunctional.

"A Half-Million Americans May Have Tick-Linked Meat Allergy, C.D.C. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/health/alpha-gal-ticks-meat-allergy.html,"When the researchers factored in this knowledge gap, they estimated that the true toll of the syndrome might be closer to a half-million, although Dr. Salzer acknowledged that the figure was “a crude estimate.”

Still, it is clear that the condition is significantly underdiagnosed, said Dr. Maya Jerath, an allergist and immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who has treated hundreds of patients with alpha-gal syndrome. “This is a story that every patient of mine tells me, that ‘I had to go to five physicians before they could tell me what it was,’” said Dr. Jerath, who was not involved in the new studies. “It’s nice to have numbers behind it, and it’s definitely a call to action.”

Alpha-gal syndrome, which was not formally identified until the 2000s, takes its name from galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, a sugar present in beef, pork, lamb and the meat of most other mammals. (It is not present in humans or other apes.) Lone star ticks, which scientists believe are the primary culprits of the disease in the United States, can transmit the sugar to people through a bite. Some people’s immune systems may then label this foreign sugar a threat and overreact to its presence the next time they eat meat.

The symptoms, which often take hours to appear, are wide-ranging, and may include hives, nausea, diarrhea or anaphylactic shock. Even patients who have the syndrome may not feel sick every time they eat meat. “It’s consistently inconsistent,” Dr. Salzer said. “So this makes it a real challenge for health care providers.”

To diagnose the syndrome, clinicians can order a blood test to determine whether a patient has antibodies to alpha-gal. Until August 2021, a single commercial lab did nearly all of this antibody testing in the United States. In one of the new studies, researchers reviewed the results of the antibody tests performed at this lab from 2017 to 2022.",0.04112554112554113,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/27/multimedia/27TICKS-01-chwp/27TICKS-01-chwp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['knowledge gap', 'true toll', 'salzer', 'crude estimate. ”', 'maya jerath', 'washington', 'louis', 'alpha-gal syndrome', '’ ”', 'jerath', 'new studies', '’ s', '’ s', 'action. ”', 'alpha-gal', 'lone', 'star ticks', 'primary culprits', 'people ’ s immune systems', 'foreign sugar', 'anaphylactic shock', '’ s', '” dr.', 'salzer', 'real challenge', 'health care providers. ”', 'blood test', 'august', 'commercial lab', 'new studies', 'antibody tests']","[('a half-million', 'CARDINAL'), ('Salzer', 'PERSON'), ('Maya Jerath', 'PERSON'), ('Washington University', 'ORG'), ('St. Louis', 'GPE'), ('hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('Jerath', 'PERSON'), ('Alpha', 'GPE'), ('the 2000s', 'DATE'), ('Lone', 'CARDINAL'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('Salzer', 'PERSON'), ('clinicians', 'NORP'), ('August 2021', 'DATE'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('2022', 'DATE')]",Science
Blood of Young Mice Extends Life in the Old,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/health/mice-blood-aging.html,"In the 1950s, Clive McCay of Cornell University and his colleagues used parabiosis to explore aging. They joined young and old rats, stitching together their flanks so that the capillaries in their skin merged. Later, Dr. McCay and his colleagues examined the cartilage in the old rats and concluded it looked younger.

In the early 2000s, parabiosis went through a renaissance. Researchers used 21st century techniques to study what happened when animals of different ages shared the same bloodstream. They found the muscles and brains of old mice were rejuvenated, while younger mice showed signs of accelerated aging.

Some doctors jumped on these preliminary results and started offering injections of blood plasma from young people as a way to treat dementia and other diseases of old age. The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against such treatments in 2019, cautioning that they “have no proven clinical benefits for the uses for which these clinics are advertising them and are potentially harmful.”

For several years, Dr. White and his colleagues have been tweaking parabiosis procedures in mice to better understand the anti-aging effects. The scientists joined an old and young mouse together for about three months — twice as long as typical parabiosis experiments — before carefully detaching them.

Flipping a Switch and Making Cancers Self-Destruct,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/health/cancer-self-destruct.html,"Within every cancer are molecules that spur deadly, uncontrollable growth. What if scientists could hook those molecules to others that make cells self-destruct? Could the very drivers of a cancer’s survival instead activate the program for its destruction?

That idea came as an epiphany to Dr. Gerald Crabtree, a developmental biologist at Stanford, some years ago during a walk through the redwoods near his home in the Santa Cruz mountains.

“I ran home,” he said, excited by the idea and planning ways to make it work.

Now, in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, Dr. Crabtree, a founder of Shenandoah Therapeutics, which is developing cancer drugs, along with Nathanael S. Gray, a professor of chemical and system biology at Stanford, and their colleagues report that they have done what he imagined on that walk.

Wastewater Data Mirrored Covid Case Counts During First Omicron Wave,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/health/wastewater-covid-coronavirus.html,"Why It Matters: Case counts have become less reliable.

Even if people who are infected with the coronavirus never seek testing or treatment, they shed the virus in their stool. That has made wastewater surveillance a useful way to keep track of how much virus is circulating in a community. At the height of the pandemic, wastewater data provided an early warning of coming surges and helped experts monitor the spread of new variants.

Now that the emergency phase of the pandemic has ended, wastewater surveillance is an even more crucial tool, experts say. This spring, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped calculating community Covid levels and collecting some other types of tracking data.

Although hospitalization rates have fallen, the virus still poses dangers, especially to people with compromised immune systems. Local wastewater data can help people and institutions, such as long-term care facilities, make more informed decisions about when to take more precautions, the researchers said.

Background: Wastewater surveillance has expanded since 2020.

In September 2020, the C.D.C. established a National Wastewater Surveillance System to centralize and standardize local efforts to track the coronavirus in sewage. Since then, the system has expanded to cover more than 1,000 sampling sites across the country.

For the new study, the researchers analyzed the publicly available wastewater data for 268 counties participating in the national surveillance system. They compared the wastewater trends in each county to the local case and hospitalization rates during the first three quarters of 2022.

From January to March, a period that overlapped with the winter Omicron wave, high levels of virus in the wastewater closely mirrored high case and hospitalization rates, the scientists found. The wastewater levels were lower during the April-to-June time frame, before rising again in the July-to-September period. But during these final three months, when wastewater levels were high, official case and hospitalization rates remained relatively low.

“Even though we saw a bump in the case rates, it wasn’t as significant as what we saw in the wastewater data,” said Dr. Meri Varkila, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and an author of the new study. “We figured that wastewater is probably the more accurate estimate of what’s actually happening in terms of Covid occurrence in communities nationwide.”

What We Don’t Know: Viral evolution is a wild card.

The coronavirus is constantly evolving. “We are assuming that inherently the virus hasn’t changed dramatically in the way that it sheds and in the way that it behaves in the environment,” said Dr. Shuchi Anand, a nephrologist at Stanford and an author of the study. But there may be future variants that show up in sewage either more or less readily than past variants have.

The population’s susceptibility will change, too, as people experience additional infections, new vaccines are rolled out, and immunity waxes and wanes. These shifts could make it difficult to predict what future spikes in wastewater levels mean for public health.

The wastewater data will remain most useful when viewed alongside other public health metrics, the researchers said.",0.12232491582491584,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/multimedia/26VIRUS-WASTEWATER-cjtv/26VIRUS-WASTEWATER-cjtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['matters', 'case', 'wastewater surveillance', 'useful way', 'wastewater data', 'early warning', 'experts monitor', 'new variants', 'emergency phase', 'wastewater surveillance', 'crucial tool', 'centers', 'disease', 'prevention', 'covid', 'hospitalization rates', 'poses dangers', 'immune systems', 'local wastewater data', 'long-term care facilities', 'background', 'wastewater', 'september', 'c.d.c', 'wastewater surveillance', 'standardize local efforts', 'new study', 'available wastewater data', 'national surveillance system', 'wastewater trends', 'local case', 'hospitalization rates', 'january', 'march', 'omicron', 'high levels', 'high case', 'hospitalization rates', 'wastewater levels', 'april-to-june', 'time frame', 'july-to-september', 'wastewater levels', 'official case', 'hospitalization rates', 'case rates', 'wasn ’ t', 'wastewater data', 'meri varkila', 'postdoctoral fellow', 'stanford', 'new study', 'accurate estimate', '’ s', 'covid', 'communities nationwide. ”', 'don', '’ t', 'know', 'viral', 'wild card', 'virus hasn ’ t', 'shuchi anand', 'stanford', 'future variants', 'past variants', 'population ’ s susceptibility', 'people experience', 'additional infections', 'new vaccines', 'immunity waxes', 'future spikes', 'wastewater levels', 'public health', 'wastewater data', 'public health metrics']","[('This spring', 'DATE'), ('the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'ORG'), ('Covid', 'PERSON'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('September 2020', 'DATE'), ('C.D.C.', 'ORG'), ('National Wastewater Surveillance System', 'ORG'), ('more than 1,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('268', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first three quarters of 2022', 'DATE'), ('January to March', 'DATE'), ('Omicron', 'PERSON'), ('April-to-June', 'DATE'), ('July', 'DATE'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('three months', 'DATE'), ('Meri Varkila', 'PERSON'), ('Stanford University', 'ORG'), ('Covid', 'PERSON'), ('Shuchi Anand', 'PERSON'), ('Stanford', 'ORG')]",Science

Older people prone to falls, which can cause brain bleeds, should be particularly cautious about taking aspirin, the findings suggest.

The Covid Origins Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/briefing/covid-origins-debate.html,"Did Covid jump from an animal to a person at a food market in Wuhan, China — or leak from a research lab there? That question remains the pandemic’s central mystery.

There may never be a definitive answer. But scientists and other experts continue to study the issue and uncover relevant information. This week, The Times Magazine published a story about Covid’s origins by David Quammen, a veteran science journalist, and I’m turning over the rest of today’s newsletter to Julian Barnes, who covers intelligence agencies in Washington. — David Leonhardt

In the early days of the pandemic, I was speaking to a variety of U.S. intelligence officials who believed that China was hiding the truth of what happened with Covid. They were right: China was.

In the name of safety, Chinese officials ordered that coronavirus samples be destroyed. At best, this hampered the later investigation into Covid’s origins, and at worst it was a sign of a cover-up.

"A Fight to Save Soldiers, From the Lab to the Battlefield",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/books/in-the-blood-charles-barber.html,"IN THE BLOOD: How Two Outsiders Solved a Centuries-Old Medical Mystery and Took On the U.S. Army, by Charles Barber

Reading, like riding shotgun with a stranger, is an act of faith, whose first moments matter. An accurate, judicious beginning often allows us to settle back and enjoy the ride, whereas an early slip or swerve means we might be white-knuckling the rest of the journey. Charles Barber’s “In the Blood” treats a consequential topic, and contains moments of real insight, drama and humor. Trouble is, Barber opens with several omissions and slights that left me on edge for the balance of the book.

Barber begins his story about catastrophic bleeding and the urgent search for a cure, appropriately enough, in the savage battle for Mogadishu in 1993. But he misstates the timing of the ill-fated U.S. raid and muffs the mission’s actual goal: to seize two of the Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid’s lieutenants, not Aidid himself. More glaringly, the Army Rangers described on the raid actually played a supporting role to commandos from Delta Force, which Barber never mentions. In a book dedicated to “the warriors,” such an oversight seems incongruous.

Yet I wanted to trust this book, because it tells an important story in vivid, engrossing terms. Though hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in both war and peacetime, we learn, the techniques for stopping it haven’t improved significantly for millenniums. Barber explores the mysteries of the “coagulation cascade” — during which diverse proteins activate in intricately choreographed sequence to facilitate clotting — as well as the “lethal triad” of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy (impaired clotting) that can send the body into shock.

We watch a surgeon at a Navy hospital in Bethesda slit the femoral arteries of a herd of 700-pound pigs, then apply different hemostatic agents to the spurting wounds, to see which substance stops the bleeding best. Most products, backed by biotech and medical companies, fail: The poor beasts bleed out. But zeolite, a simple mineral with hitherto unknown hemostatic properties, saves their bacon every time.",0.1392857142857143,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/30/multimedia/30Barber-review-quikclot-cmkp/30Barber-review-quikclot-cmkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['in the blood', 'outsiders solved', 'centuries-old', 'mystery', 'took', 'u.s.', 'charles barber reading', 'moments matter', 'judicious beginning', 'early slip', 'charles barber', '’ s “', 'blood', '” treats', 'consequential topic', 'contains moments', 'real insight', 'trouble', 'barber', 'barber', 'urgent search', 'savage battle', 'mogadishu', 'u.s.', 'mission ’ s', 'actual goal', 'somali', 'mohamed aidid', '’ s lieutenants', 'aidid', 'rangers', 'delta', 'barber', 'important story', 'haven ’ t', 'barber', '“ coagulation cascade ” —', 'diverse proteins activate', '“ lethal triad ”', 'navy hospital', 'bethesda', 'femoral arteries', '700-pound pigs', 'different hemostatic agents', 'substance stops', 'medical companies', 'poor beasts', 'simple mineral', 'unknown hemostatic properties']","[('the U.S. Army', 'ORG'), ('Charles Barber\n\n', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Charles Barber’s', 'PERSON'), ('In the Blood', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Barber', 'PERSON'), ('Barber', 'PERSON'), ('Mogadishu', 'GPE'), ('1993', 'DATE'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Somali', 'NORP'), ('Mohamed Aidid', 'PERSON'), ('Aidid', 'PERSON'), ('Army Rangers', 'ORG'), ('Delta Force', 'ORG'), ('Barber', 'PERSON'), ('Barber', 'PERSON'), ('Navy', 'ORG'), ('Bethesda', 'GPE'), ('700-pound', 'QUANTITY')]",Science
The Prize for the Longest Pregnancy in Mammals May Go to This Whale,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/science/bowhead-whales-pregnancy.html,"For animals that humans almost drove into extinction, there’s a lot about whales we still don’t know. Consider the bowhead whale in particular.

“Bowhead whales can live greater than 200 years, they go into sexual maturity late and it takes them a long time to grow,” said Nadine Lysiak, a marine biologist who has been studying bowheads and other baleen whales for years. “But even today, we’re still learning very basic things about the reproductive cycle of animals like these. They’re very cryptic, we don’t see most of their life since they spend a fraction of it at the surface.”

Slowly but surely, Dr. Lysiak has been peeling back the layers of aquatic secrecy surrounding these white-chinned travelers of the Arctic Ocean. She and her colleagues may have uncovered a rather extraordinary feat of nature: Females of the species may spend 23 months pregnant before giving birth to a baby bowhead. That would edge out elephant pregnancies — the longest known within the mammalian kingdom — by a month.

Their findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science, illuminate the complexities underlying the whale’s population growth, which Dr. Lysiak hopes can guide conservation efforts, especially as an inhospitable climate looms.",0.14086452762923352,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/25/climate/25tb-bowhead-02/25tb-bowhead-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['’ s', 'don ’ t', 'consider', 'bowhead whale', 'bowhead', 'sexual maturity', 'long time', 'nadine lysiak', 'marine biologist', 'baleen whales', '’ re', 'basic things', 'reproductive cycle', '’ re', 'don ’ t', 'surface. ”', 'slowly', 'lysiak', 'aquatic secrecy', 'arctic', 'extraordinary feat', 'females', 'months pregnant', 'baby bowhead', 'elephant pregnancies —', 'mammalian kingdom —', 'royal society open science', 'whale ’ s population growth', 'lysiak', 'conservation efforts', 'inhospitable climate looms']","[('Nadine Lysiak', 'PERSON'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Lysiak', 'PERSON'), ('the Arctic Ocean', 'LOC'), ('23 months', 'DATE'), ('a month', 'DATE'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('Royal Society Open Science', 'ORG'), ('Lysiak', 'PERSON')]",Science
Warming Could Push the Atlantic Past a ‘Tipping Point’ This Century,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/climate/atlantic-ocean-tipping-point.html,"The last time there was a major slowdown in the mighty network of ocean currents that shapes the climate around the North Atlantic, it seems to have plunged Europe into a deep cold for over a millennium.

That was roughly 12,800 years ago, when not many people were around to experience it. But in recent decades, human-driven warming could be causing the currents to slow once more, and scientists have been working to determine whether and when they might undergo another great weakening, which would have ripple effects for weather patterns across a swath of the globe.

A pair of researchers in Denmark this week put forth a bold answer: A sharp weakening of the currents, or even a shutdown, could be upon us by century’s end.

It was a surprise even to the researchers that their analysis showed a potential collapse coming so soon, one of them, Susanne Ditlevsen, a professor of statistics at the University of Copenhagen, said in an interview.

Could the Next Pandemic Start at the County Fair?,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/health/swine-flu-pigs-agriculture.html,"Still, some health recommendations, such as the advice to avoid eating or drinking around the animals, have been a tough sell. For many families, some of whom bring crockpots into the barn with them, sharing a meal at a show is a way of building community. And with shows that can last all day, it can also be a logistical necessity, Ms. Morgan said: “I mean, you have to feed kids or they get very hangry.”

Ultimately, the Ohio State team decided to ease off the recommendation, worried that it was so out of step with the culture that it would undermine their credibility. (It’s also not clear how much eating and drinking might increase the risk for people who are already spending hours sharing air with their pigs, Dr. Nolting acknowledged.)

It is hard to determine how effective the team’s efforts have been overall; the surveillance is still fairly new, and some flu seasons are naturally worse than others. “But I think we have moved the needle,” Dr. Bowman said. “There is change happening.”

Pigs are not the only farm animals that can carry dangerous pathogens, and the researchers recently began an educational program for people buying chicks at farm stores. They may create a cattle-focused program, too, Dr. Nolting said.

“We’ve talked about what our logo is going to look like, if it’s, ‘Swientist and Friends,’” Dr. Nolting said. “Maybe our pig in the lab coat has his buddies with him.”

"Some July Heat: ‘Virtually Impossible’ Without Climate Change, Analysis Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/climate/us-europe-heat-waves-climate-change.html,"Some of the extreme temperatures recorded in the Southwestern United States, southern Europe and northern Mexico at the beginning of the month would have been “virtually impossible” without the influence of human-caused climate change, according to research made public Tuesday.

During the first half of July hundreds of millions of people in North America, Europe and Asia sweltered under intense heat waves. A heat wave in China was made 50 times as likely by climate change, the researchers said.

World Weather Attribution, an international group of scientists who measure how much climate change influences extreme weather events, focused on the worst heat so far during the northern hemisphere summer. In the United States, temperatures in Phoenix have reached 110 degrees Fahrenheit, roughly 43 Celsius, or higher for more than 20 days in a row. Many places in southern Europe are experiencing record-breaking, triple-digit temperatures. A remote township in Xinjiang, China, hit 126 degrees, breaking the national record.

Mars Science Lab launch delayed two years,http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/12/04/nasa.mars.delay/index.html?eref=edition_space,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- NASA's launch of the Mars Science Laboratory -- hampered by technical difficulties and cost overruns -- has been delayed until the fall of 2011, NASA officials said at a news conference Thursday in Washington.

A photo illustration of a laser-equipped vehicle that is set to be part of the Mars Science Laboratory.

The mission had been scheduled for launch in the fall of 2009.

The Mars Science Lab is a large, nuclear-powered rover designed to traverse long distances with a suite of onboard scientific instruments aboard.

It is, according to NASA's Web site, part of a ""long-term effort of robotic exploration"" established to ""study the early environmental history of Mars"" and assess whether Mars has ever been -- or still is -- able to sustain life.

The delay of the launch, according to NASA, is due to a number of ""testing and hardware challenges that must (still) be addressed to ensure mission success.""

""The progress in recent weeks has not come fast enough on solving technical challenges and pulling hardware together,"" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Changing to a 2011 launch ""will allow for careful resolution of any remaining technical problems, proper and thorough testing, and avoid a mad dash to launch,"" argued NASA Associate Administrator Ed Weiler.

The overall cost of the Mars Science Lab is now projected to be roughly $2.1 billion, according to NASA spokesman Dwayne Browne. The project originally carried a price tag of $1.6 billion.

NASA's entire budget for the current fiscal year, according to Browne, is approximately $15 billion.

According to NASA, the Mars rover will use new technologies and be engineered to explore greater distances over rougher terrain than previous missions to the planet. This will be done in part by employing a new surface propulsion system.

""Failure is not an option on this mission,"" Weiler said. ""The science is too important and the investment of American taxpayer dollars compels us to be absolutely certain that we have done everything possible to ensure the success of this flagship planetary mission.""

Weiler asserted that, based on the agency's preliminary evaluations, additional costs tied to the delay of the Science Lab launch would not result in the cancellation of other NASA programs over the next two years. He did, however, concede that it would result in other unspecified program delays.

Critics have charged that the delay and cost overruns associated with the Mars Science Lab are indicative of an agency that is plagued by a lack of accountability and inefficiency in terms of its management of both time and taxpayer dollars.

""The Mars Science Laboratory is only the latest symptom of a NASA culture that has lost control of spending,"" wrote Alan Stern, a former NASA associate administrator, in a November 24 op-ed in the New York Times. ""A cancer is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.""

Stern charged that the agency's cost overruns are being fueled by ""managers who disguise the size of cost increases that missions incur"" and ""members of Congress who accept steep increases to protect local jobs.""

Browne replied in a written statement saying that NASA administrators are ""constantly working to improve (the agency's) cost-estimating capabilities. ... We continually review our projects to understand the true risk in terms of performance, cost and schedule.""

""The fact of life at NASA, where we are charged with creating first-of-a-kind missions of scientific discovery, is that estimating the costs of ... science can be almost as difficult as actually doing the science,"" Browne said.

NASA's most recent Mars project -- the mission of the Phoenix Mars Lander -- came to an end last month after the solar-powered vehicle's batteries ran down as the result of a dust storm and the onset of Martian winter. It had operated two months beyond its initial three-month mission.

NASA officials had landed the vehicle on an arctic plain after satellite observations indicated there were vast quantities of frozen water in that area, most likely in the form of permafrost. They thought such a location would be a promising place to look for organic chemicals that would signal a habitable environment.

Scientists were able to verify the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, find small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life, and observe snow descending from the clouds, NASA said Thursday.

Shuttle Endeavour lands at California air base,http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/11/30/space.shuttle/index.html?eref=edition_space,"(CNN) -- Space shuttle Endeavour landed safely Sunday afternoon at California's Edwards Air Force Base after NASA waved off two opportunities for a Florida landing because of poor weather.

Endeavour glides in for a landing Sunday at California's Edwards Air Force Base.

The shuttle, steered by commander Christopher Ferguson, landed at 1:25 p.m., ending a mission that lasted more than two weeks.

Wind, rain and reports of thunderstorms within 30 miles of the shuttle landing facility at Florida's Kennedy Space Center prompted NASA to cancel the landing attempts there. Those had been scheduled for 1:19 p.m. and 2:54 p.m. ET.

After determining Monday's weather forecast at Kennedy Space Center was equally unpromising, flight controllers decided they would try to land the shuttle and its seven astronauts at Edwards AFB, about 100 miles from Los Angeles, California, where Sunday's forecast was sunny.

Flight controllers prefer landings at Kennedy Space Center because of cost and schedule. NASA has estimated it costs about $1.7 million to bring a shuttle home to Kennedy Space Center from California. Watch Endeavour's Sunday landing in California »

It also takes at least a week to get the shuttle ready for the trip, but schedule is not a major factor for the Endeavour; it is not scheduled to fly again until May.

Endeavour's 15-day mission to the international space station began on November 14 and included four spacewalks.

During that time, the crew brought key pieces -- including exercise equipment, more sleeping berths and a urine recycling system -- for a project to double the capacity of the station from three in-house astronauts to six.

The recycling system was installed to turn urine and sweat from the astronauts into drinking water.

Other modules are scheduled to arrive on a February shuttle flight. The goal of expanding the station's capacity to six astronauts is expected to be reached by the summer.

The crew also worked on a joint that helps generate power for the space station. Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper and Steve Bowen spent hours cleaning and lubricating the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, which is designed to allow the solar panels on the left side of the station to rotate and track the sun.

The astronauts also removed and replaced several trundle bearing assemblies.

The mission went according to plan, despite a minor interruption on the first spacewalk when a grease gun in Stefanyshyn-Piper tool's bag leaked, coating everything inside with a film of lubricant. While she was trying to clean it up, the bag -- with $100,000 in tools -- floated away.

Probing the cosmos: Is anybody out there?,http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/11/26/aliens.tarter/index.html?eref=edition_space,"(CNN) -- From a remote valley in Northern California, Jill Tarter is listening to the universe.

Jill Tarter at the Allen Telescope Array in California, which monitors radio signals for signs of alien life.

Her ears are 42 large and sophisticated radio telescopes, spread across several acres, that scan the cosmos for signals of extraterrestrial origin. If intelligent life forms do exist on other planets, and they try to contact us, Tarter will be among the first to know.

Are we citizens of Earth alone in the universe? It's a question that has long fascinated astronomers, sci-fi authors, kids with backyard telescopes and Hollywood executives who churn out spectacles about alien encounters. Polls have found that most Americans believe that some form of life exists beyond our planet.

""It's a fundamental question,"" said Tarter, the real-life inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 movie ""Contact."" ""And it's a question that the person on the street can understand. It's not like a ... super-collider or some search for neutrinos buried in the ice. It's, 'Are we alone? How might we find out? What does that tell us about ourselves and our place in the universe?'

""We're trying to figure out how the universe began, how galaxies and large-scale structures formed, and where did the origins of life as we know it take place?"" Tarter said.

""These are all valid questions to ask of the universe. And an equally valid question is whether the same thing that happened here [on Earth] has happened elsewhere."" Watch a preview of CNN's ""In Search of Aliens"" series »

Thanks to advancements in technology, scientists hope to get an answer sooner rather than later. Rovers have snapped photographs of the surface of Mars that show fossil-like shapes. NASA hopes to launch within a decade a Terrestrial Planet Finder, an orbiting observatory that would detect planets around nearby stars and determine whether they could support life.

Such developments are catnip to scientists like Geoffrey Marcy, a professor of astronomy at the University of California-Berkeley who has discovered more extrasolar planets than anyone else.

""It wasn't more than 13 years ago that we hadn't found any planets around the stars, and most people thought that we never would. So here we are not only having found planets, we are looking for habitable planets, signs of biology on those planets,"" Marcy told CNN. ""It's an extraordinary explosion of a field of science that didn't even exist just a few years ago.""

Then there's Tarter, whose quest for signs of extraterrestrial life kept her on the fringes of mainstream science for decades. While pursuing her doctorate at UC-Berkeley, Tarter came across an engineering report that floated the idea of using radio telescopes to listen for broadcasts by alien beings.

It became her life's work. In 1984 Tarter founded the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) in California. Using telescopes in Australia, West Virginia and Puerto Rico, she conducted a decade-long scouring of about 750 nearby star systems for extraterrestrial radio signals.

None was found, although Tarter had some false alarms. In 1998, she intercepted a mysterious signal that lasted for hours. Tarter got so excited she misread her own computer results: The signal was coming from a NASA observatory spacecraft orbiting the sun.

Today, Tarter listens to the heavens with the Allen Telescope Array, a collection of 20-foot-wide telescopes some 300 miles north of San Francisco. The dish-like scopes are a joint effort of SETI and UC-Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Lab and have been funded largely by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who donated more than $25 million to the project.

Unlike previously existing radio telescopes, which scan the sky for limited periods of time, the Allen Telescope Array probes the universe round the clock.

Each of the 42 scopes is aimed at a different area of the sky, collecting reams of data that are continually studied by computers for unusual patterns. Then the listeners must filter out noise from airplanes and satellites.

""We're listening for something that we don't think can be produced by Mother Nature,"" Tarter said. ""We're using the radio frequency, other people are using optical telescopes ... and in both cases we're looking for an artificial nature to a signal.

""In the case of radio, we're looking for a lot of power being squished into just one channel on the radio dial. In the optical, they're looking for very bright flashes that last a nanosecond ... or less, not slow pulsing kinds of things. To date we've never found a natural source that can do that.""

Signals that any extraterrestrials might be transmitting for their own use would be difficult to detect, Tarter said. Astronomers are more likely to discover a radio transmission broadcast intentionally at the Earth, she said.

Astronomers at SETI, however, are not sending a signal into space in an attempt to communicate with aliens.

University of California professor Marcy is skeptical about the existence of intelligent alien life and believes our galaxy's vast distances would make communication between Earth and beings on other planets almost impossible.

""The nearest neighbor might be halfway across our galaxy, 50,000 light-years away. Communicating with them will take a hundred thousand years for a round-trip signal,"" he said.

Still, Tarter remains undaunted. The Allen Telescope Array already does in 10 minutes what once took her scientists 10 days. When the project is completed, it will have 350 telescopes that, combined, can survey tens of thousands of star systems.

""We can look in more places and more frequencies faster than we ever could. And that will just get better with time. We're doing something now we couldn't do when we started, we couldn't do five years ago,"" she said.

""Think of it as a cosmic haystack. There's a needle in there somewhere. If you pull out a few straws, are you going to get disappointed because you haven't found the needle yet? No. We haven't really begun to explore.""

Indian lunar orbiter hit by heat rise,http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/11/26/india.moon.probe/index.html?eref=edition_space,"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Scientists have switched off several on-board instruments to halt rising temperatures inside India's first unmanned lunar spacecraft.

The spacecraft carrying India's first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, lifts off from Sriharikota.

Mylswamy Annadurai, the project director for the lunar mission, told CNN that temperatures onboard Chandrayaan-1 had risen to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).

The increase occurred as the craft, the moon -- which it is orbiting -- and the sun lined up, a phenomenon which Annadurai said was not unexpected and which would likely last until the end of December.

""We have switched off the systems (aboard) that are not needed to be on,"" Annadurai said, ruling out the possibility of damage and adding that the temperature was now down to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

Heat on board the Chandrayaan-1 should not exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), Annadurai said -- but insisted the orbiter is designed to withstand up to 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit).

The Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit -- was successfully launched from southern India on October 22. Watch the launch of India's first lunar mission »

Its two-year mission is to take high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the moon's surface, especially the permanently shadowed polar regions. It also will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks, the group said.

Earlier this month the Moon Impact Probe detached from Chandrayaan-1 and successfully crash-landed on the moon's surface.

Officials say that the TV-size probe, which is adorned with a painting of the Indian flag, hit the moon's surface at a speed of 5,760 kilometers per hour (3,579 mph).

It transmitted data to Chandrayaan-1 ahead of impact but was not intended to be retrieved after that.

Chandrayaan-1 is carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria. India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs, including NASA.

Social Security’s Next Cost-of-Living Raise Is Forecast Around 3%,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/social-security-cola-medicare.html,"More than 74 million Americans can expect a healthy inflation adjustment to their Social Security benefits next year — just not as large as this year’s historic 8.7 percent raise.

The Robots We Were Afraid of Are Already Here,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/business/robots-workers-future.html,"Digit drew a crowd, even here, in a convention center full of robot aficionados.

A humanoid warehouse worker, Digit walked upright on goatlike legs and grabbed bins off a shelf with muscular arms made from aerospace-grade aluminum. It then placed the boxes on an assembly line and walked back to the shelf to search for more. The crowd, which had assembled at ProMat, the premier trade show for the manufacturing and supply chain industry, held up phones and watched, a little quiet, wondering if at some point the robot would teeter and fall. It did not.

Digit, made by Oregon-based Agility Robotics, is the kind of technology that people have worried about for generations: a machine with the strength and adroitness to rival our own, and the ability to take our jobs, or much worse. Then ChatGPT came online, and suddenly the fear was of something smarter rather than stronger — malevolent bots rather than metallic brutes.

It might not be ready to take over the Amazon warehouse yet, but the long-anticipated robot revolution has begun, accelerated in large part by the pandemic and the thunderous growth of e-commerce.

Judge Raag Singhal, who was nominated to the District Court by Mr. Trump in 2019, stated in dismissing the suit late Friday night that CNN’s use of the phrase in connection with Mr. Trump’s election challenges “does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people.”

The judge added: “The Court finds Nazi references in the political discourse (made by whichever ‘side’) to be odious and repugnant. But bad rhetoric is not defamation when it does not include false statements of fact.”",-0.1125,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/30/multimedia/30trump-lawsuit-1-hwlm/30trump-lawsuit-1-hwlm-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['federal judge', 'defamation lawsuit', 'donald j. trump', 'cnn', 'cnn', 'mr. trump', 'mr. trump', 'october', 'u.s.', 'district court', 'lauderdale', 'fla.', '“ campaign', 'slander ”', 'mr. trump', 'cnn', '2024. ”', 'network ’ s', 'phrase “', 'big lie ”', 'mr. trump', '’ s efforts', 'presidential election', 'adolf hitler', 'nazism', 'raag singhal', 'district court', 'mr. trump', 'cnn', '’ s', 'mr. trump', '’ s election', 'plausible inference', 'trump', 'jews', 'people. ”', 'nazi', 'political discourse', '‘ side ’', 'bad rhetoric', 'false statements']","[('$475 million', 'MONEY'), ('Donald J.

"After Affirmative Action Ruling, Legacy Admissions Take Center Stage",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/business/dealbook/affirmative-action-legacy-admissions.html,"Wesleyan University, a liberal arts college in Connecticut, announced two weeks ago that it was ending legacy admissions. Other schools, including Amherst, Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon, have also dropped programs that favor alumni. However, many have not — at least not yet.

Many elite schools say legacy admissions are important for maintaining relationships with alumni, which can help universities raise money that is then available for financial aid to needy students. In a June 2018 legal filing in the case that led to the Supreme Court’s affirmative action decision, Harvard argued that “there would be substantial costs” to ending legacy admissions.

But how substantial? The answer is about more than fund-raising.

Legacy students may donate more. In a study published last year in the American Sociological Review, researchers looked at 16 years of admissions data from a school described as “representative of elite U.S. institutions.” They found that legacy students were more likely to have wealthy parents and come from families flagged as big donors. Such students also tended to donate more after graduating than other students, even though both groups earned similar incomes.

But less than a quarter of donations come directly from alumni, according to an estimate by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. “No fund-raising shop is going to have to make up half of their gift revenue if there’s a change in the admission office about legacy admissions,” said Mickey Munley, a fund-raising consultant for schools and a former vice president of alumni relations at a private liberal arts college in Iowa. “It’s overplayed.” In addition, donations account for a small portion of revenue at extremely selective schools. At Wesleyan, donations make up just 3 percent of operating revenue.

Legacy status may also work as a proxy for financial need. In the American Sociological Review study, legacy students were about half as likely to apply for financial aid as admitted students who weren’t related to alumni. In other words, these students are more likely to be able to pay full tuition without help from the university. “It’s a way to circumvent need-blind policies,” said Richard D. Kahlenberg, an education expert and a nonresident scholar at Georgetown University. “You can be fairly confident in many cases that those students will be able to pay the full tuition and not require financial aid.”",0.15444444444444444,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/business/29DB-LEGACY2/29DB-LEGACY2-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['wesleyan', 'liberal arts college', 'connecticut', 'legacy admissions', 'amherst', 'hopkins', 'carnegie mellon', 'elite schools', 'legacy admissions', 'financial aid', 'needy students', 'june', 'supreme court ’ s affirmative action decision', 'harvard', 'substantial costs ”', 'legacy admissions', 'legacy', 'sociological review', 'admissions data', '“ representative', 'u.s.', 'institutions. ”', 'legacy students', 'wealthy parents', 'big donors', 'such students', 'similar incomes', 'advancement', 'support', 'fund-raising shop', 'gift revenue', '’ s', 'admission office', 'legacy admissions', 'mickey munley', 'fund-raising consultant', 'vice president', 'alumni relations', 'private liberal arts college', 'iowa', '’ s overplayed. ”', 'small portion', 'selective schools', 'wesleyan', 'legacy', 'financial need', 'sociological review', 'legacy students', 'financial aid', 'weren ’ t', 'full tuition', '’ s', 'circumvent need-blind policies', 'richard d. kahlenberg', 'education expert', 'nonresident scholar', 'georgetown', 'full tuition', 'financial aid']","[('Wesleyan University', 'ORG'), ('Connecticut', 'GPE'), ('two weeks ago', 'DATE'), ('Amherst', 'NORP'), ('Johns Hopkins', 'ORG'), ('Carnegie Mellon', 'ORG'), ('June 2018', 'DATE'), ('the Supreme Court’s', 'ORG'), ('Harvard', 'ORG'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('the American Sociological Review', 'ORG'), ('16 years', 'DATE'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('less than a quarter', 'DATE'), ('the Council for Advancement and Support of Education', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mickey Munley', 'PERSON'), ('Iowa', 'GPE'), ('Wesleyan', 'ORG'), ('just 3 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the American Sociological Review', 'ORG'), ('about half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Richard D.

‘A Dangerous Combination’: Teenagers’ Accidents Expose E-Bike Risks,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/health/ebikes-safety-teens.html,"Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to the police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.

The e-bike industry is booming, but the summer of 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can go 70 miles an hour. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.

“The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it’s too slow to be in traffic,” said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating Brodee’s accident. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner’s finding.

To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.",0.09166666666666667,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/multimedia/29ebike-risk-promo-pfmz/29ebike-risk-promo-pfmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['teenage boy', 'bmw', 'according', 'encinitas', 'e-bike safety', 'e-bike industry', 'sharp questions', 'safe e-bikes', '20-mile-per-hour speed limit', 'legal speeds', 'complex traffic', '’ s', 'jeremy collis', 'coastal', 'san diego', 'county sheriff ’ s office', 'brodee', '’ s accident', 'medical examiner ’ s', 'law enforcement officials', 'safety guidelines', 'industry officials charge', 'evade speed limits', 'young riders']","[('Three days later', 'DATE'), ('BMW', 'ORG'), ('the days', 'DATE'), ('Encinitas', 'GPE'), ('the summer of 2023', 'DATE'), ('20-mile-per-hour', 'QUANTITY'), ('70 miles an hour', 'QUANTITY'), ('Jeremy Collis', 'PERSON'), ('the North Coastal Station of', 'ORG'), ('the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office', 'GPE'), ('Brodee', 'ORG')]",Business
"What Is an E-Bike, and How Safe Are They?",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/health/ebikes-safety-regulation.html,"Class 1: Maximum speed, 20 m.p.h.; the motor may provide power only while the rider is pedaling. (This is known as “pedal assist.”) Age restrictions: None in most states, although some states, such as Oregon, do not permit the use of any class of e-bike by riders younger than 16.

Class 2: Maximum speed, 20 m.p.h.; the motor may provide power independently of the pedals. Age restrictions: none in most states. (These e-bikes in particular attract criticism because, by relying solely on the motor, they can achieve immediate bursts of speed.)

Class 3: Maximum speed, 28 m.p.h. — but only if the pedals and the motor are used simultaneously. These vehicles are intended for commuters and other riders who are interested in traveling farther than a traditional bicycle would easily allow. Use not permitted by riders younger than 16, in many states.

Notably, the federal consumer agency does not recognize the three-class system.

What Are the State Rules?

According to PeopleForBikes, the trade group that helped craft the three-class system for manufacturers, 42 states have laws that are largely in line with the classification system. In most states, then, riders under 16 can use Class 1 and Class 2 e-bikes, while riders of Class 3 e-bikes must be 16 or older.

But enforcing those rules is tricky, according to local and state law enforcement officials. It can be hard to tell by looking if a teenage rider is too young for the e-bike being ridden.

"For Your Broken Heart, Consider a Breakup Budget",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/business/retail-therapy-breakup-budget.html,"For a month after a breakup in early June, I wavered between empowered mania and “Wuthering Heights” anguish. If I’d had access to moors I would have roamed them nightly à la the book’s brutish, tormented hero, Heathcliff, wild-haired and sporting a messy cravat, but I was in Austin, Texas, where there is nary a moor and it’s too hot for roaming. So, as I had done after previous breakups, I dabbled in retail therapy.

Once, I spent $100 on a wooden gorilla. On another occasion, I bought a philodendron that has since taken over my home, “Jumanji”-style. (If your aim is to purge a lover’s memory, I suggest a less invasive plant.)

After this most recent split, however, I left the sphere of retail therapy and waltzed on the plane of shopping addiction. Sadly, the one thing I deemed too expensive was talking to a therapist. Instead, I bought a ticket to Mexico to join my sister at a resort I couldn’t afford. I signed up for a Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card, with its $550 annual fee and impressive travel benefits, reasoning that it would make more trips to Mexico possible.

I spent $165 on a deep-tissue massage and $130 on an annual subscription to MasterClass. I mined La Perla’s sale items, which are still preposterously expensive.

"With Actors on Strike, Sony Pushes Big Releases to 2024",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/actors-strike-movies.html,"Hollywood studios, scrambling to contend with a strike by unionized actors, have started to remove big-budget movies from the 2023 release calendar, newly imperiling theaters and undoubtedly irritating fans.

Sony Pictures Entertainment on Friday pushed back the release of two major films that had been set to arrive in theaters by the end of the year — the Marvel Comics-based “Kraven the Hunter” and a sequel to “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.”

In addition, Sony is postponing some of its big 2024 releases. “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse,” is no longer on track for a March premiere, and a new “Karate Kid” will no longer arrive in June.

Until now, the 2023 theatrical release schedule had been left relatively unscathed by the actors’ strike, which started on July 14. But other studios are likely to follow Sony’s lead.

Mastercard Moves to Stop Use of Debit Cards at Cannabis Shops,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/mastercard-debit-cannabis-transactions.html,"Mastercard instructed U.S. financial institutions this week to stop allowing purchases of cannabis on its debit cards, stripping customers of a convenient way to purchase marijuana without cash. Cannabis businesses say the decision will increase the risk of robbery and violent crime.

Because federal law prohibits the sale, possession and use of marijuana in all its forms, Mastercard said that purchases were not allowed on its systems, even when customers use bank cards and PINs to access their own cash to buy cannabis in states where the drug is legal for recreational or medical reasons.

“As we were made aware of this matter, we quickly investigated it,” a spokesman for Mastercard, one of the world’s largest payment processors, said in a statement on Friday. “In accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that offer payments services to cannabis merchants and connects them to Mastercard to terminate the activity.”

Emmy Awards Will Be Postponed Because of Actors’ and Writers’ Strikes,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/media/emmy-awards-postponed-strikes.html,"The fallout from the Hollywood actors’ and writers’ strikes continues.

Emmy organizers are hopeful that would give the Hollywood studios enough time to settle the labor disputes. A new date will be finalized in the next few weeks.

Quantum Tech Will Transform National Security. It’s Testing U.S. Alliances Now.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/world/australia/quantum-technology-aukus.html,"According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s critical technology tracker, China appears to be lagging more in quantum computers — which perform many calculations in one pass, making them faster than today’s digital computers that perform each calculation separately — while narrowing the gap in quantum sensing for navigation, mapping and detection. Chinese scientists have even said they are building a quantum-based radar to find stealth aircraft with a small electromagnetic storm, though quantum specialists outside China have questioned their claims.

One of the doubters is Michael Biercuk, 43, the founder of Q-CTRL, an American physicist with a military mien and a Harvard Ph.D. who moved to Australia in 2010 to teach at the University of Sydney. He and his start-up, with offices in Sydney, Los Angeles, Berlin and Oxford, are among a cutting-edge group of global quantum leaders who see hyperbole and statecraft in many Chinese quantum announcements and hope to capitalize on what technology-sharing partnerships like the AUKUS security agreement represent.

"Wage Growth Slowed in Second Quarter, a Sign the Economy is Cooling",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/inflation-wages-economy.html,"So far, that is exactly what is happening. Wage growth, by various measures, has softened in recent months, but inflation has fallen by even more. Workers are better off as a result: Pay, adjusted for inflation, rose in the second quarter for the first time in two years.

“Households are getting back some purchasing power,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist for U.S. Bank.

Still, many economists argue wages are still rising too quickly for the Fed’s comfort, particularly in certain sectors such as leisure and hospitality. If compensation costs keep rising at their recent pace, companies are likely to keep raising prices — especially if consumers prove willing to keep spending anyway, as they have recently.

“At the end of the day, if the wage bill is rising at between 4 and 4.5 percent, it will be hard for the Fed to have confidence that services inflation will be consistent with their preferred outcome,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist for Bank of America.

The slowdown in wage growth has surprised some economists because the unemployment rate remains very low, which ordinarily would put pressure on companies to raise pay to attract and retain workers. But other evidence suggests that the labor market has softened even without a big increase in joblessness. Employers are posting fewer job openings, are adding fewer new jobs and are poaching fewer employees from competitors, all signs that demand for workers has slowed. At the same time, the supply of workers has increased, as immigration has picked up and more people are coming off the sidelines to join the labor force.",0.1316315868040006,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28econ-wages-2-vfpg/28econ-wages-2-vfpg-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['wage', 'various measures', 'recent months', 'pay', 'households', 'beth ann bovino', 'chief economist', 'u.s.', 'fed', '’ s comfort', 'certain sectors', 'compensation costs', 'recent pace', 'prices —', 'wage bill', 'fed', 'services inflation', 'michael gapen', 'u.s.', 'america', 'wage growth', 'unemployment rate', 'evidence suggests', 'labor market', 'big increase', 'employers', 'job openings', 'new jobs', 'labor force']","[('recent months', 'DATE'), ('the second quarter', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('two years', 'DATE'), ('Households', 'ORG'), ('Beth Ann Bovino', 'PERSON'), ('U.S. Bank', 'ORG'), ('Fed', 'ORG'), ('the end of the day', 'DATE'), ('between 4 and 4.5 percent', 'CARDINAL'), ('Fed', 'ORG'), ('Michael Gapen', 'PERSON'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('Bank of America', 'ORG')]",Business

Why ‘Soft Landing’ Optimists Shouldn’t Celebrate Just Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/dealbook/economy-soft-landing-interest-rates.html,"The principle is that nature is an unpaid worker providing services, like carbon sequestration, soil retention, water filtration, replenishing raw materials and more. It is providing an invisible subsidy to world economies. Protecting the environment is portfolio management.

How would placing a price tag on nature help?

Take carbon pricing. If you can put a value on a ton of carbon dioxide, which we can do now, then why wouldn’t it be feasible to pay countries to not drill for oil or cut their trees, to protect resources instead of exploiting them?

Poor countries that have abundant natural resources are loaning their economic resources, like the carbon-sequestering value of their rainforests, to rich countries without compensation. Last year at COP [the U.N. climate conference], [Special Presidential Envoy for Climate] John Kerry practically begged the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to drill for oil in rainforest and peat lands, which would release lots of carbon, and the retort was “pay us.” It’s not a bad answer, actually.

Are there examples of successful projects for preserving natural resources?

The Forest Resilience Bond is the brainchild of four Berkeley graduate students. What they did was look at standing forests in the Lake Tahoe area as infrastructure. And they raised funds to maintain the forest — like you would for an infrastructure project — from the beneficiaries of the environment, such as the local wildlife service, the tourism industry, insurers and even hydropower companies that rely on standing forest to replenish groundwater. That kind of bond could be done all around the world.

Why add such a pricing structure when economies can exploit nature for free?

We are facing real costs now. Nature is the thing underpinning our economies and it is a depreciating asset. We speculate about price all the time when it comes to company valuations. Yet the atmosphere is worth nothing. We need a new kind of thinking.",0.22337988098857664,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28db-inflation-lkvz/28db-inflation-lkvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['unpaid worker', 'carbon sequestration', 'soil retention', 'water filtration', 'raw materials', 'invisible subsidy', 'world economies', 'protecting', 'portfolio management', 'price tag', 'carbon dioxide', 'wouldn ’ t', 'poor', 'natural resources', 'economic resources', 'rich countries', 'cop', 'u.n.', 'climate conference ]', 'envoy', 'climate', 'john kerry', 'democratic republic', 'congo', 'peat lands', 'release lots', '“ pay us. ”', '’ s', 'successful projects', 'natural resources', 'resilience bond', 'berkeley', 'graduate students', 'tahoe', 'forest —', 'infrastructure project —', 'local wildlife service', 'tourism industry', 'hydropower companies', 'replenish groundwater', 'nature', 'company valuations', 'new kind']","[('a ton', 'QUANTITY'), ('Last year', 'DATE'), ('COP', 'ORG'), ('U.N.', 'ORG'), ('Special Presidential Envoy for Climate', 'ORG'), ('John Kerry', 'PERSON'), ('the Democratic Republic of the', 'GPE'), ('Congo', 'GPE'), ('The Forest Resilience Bond', 'ORG'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('Berkeley', 'ORG'), ('Lake Tahoe', 'LOC')]",Business

Exxon Reports Leaner Earnings in Second Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-oil-earnings.html,"The Numbers

Exxon’s revenue declined in the latest quarter, to $82.9 billion from $115.7 billion a year earlier. The company reported earnings per share of $1.94, compared with $4.21 in the second quarter last year.

Exxon’s reduced profit is relative to the unusual level achieved in a roiled energy market a year ago. It is higher than the second-quarter profit of $4.7 billion in 2021.

Other energy companies have also reported declining income. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, said on Sunday that its second-quarter income was $6 billion, down from $6.6 billion in the first quarter and nearly a 50 percent decline from a $11.6 billion profit in the second quarter of last year.

Shell, the largest European energy company, on Thursday announced a second-quarter profit of $5.07 billion, down 56 percent from last year.

Notable: Record production in the Permian Basin and in Guyana.

Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, said on a conference call with investment analysts that he was pleased with the results, pointing out that the company’s earnings were nearly twice what it made in the second quarter of 2018, an environment that he said had “comparable industry commodity prices.”

“That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advanced projects and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do,” Mr. Woods said.

Exxon also announced record production efforts in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where, Mr. Woods said, the company is on track for overall growth of 10 percent this year, and in Guyana, where the company set a quarterly gross production record of 380,000 barrels per day.

But Mr. Woods emphasized that the company would be cost-conscious. “We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of this year,” he said. “As we develop plans for future years, we’re committed to finding additional savings.”

Quotable: ‘A much more constrained environment.’

Roger Read, a senior energy analyst at Wells Fargo, said energy companies had gotten more careful in recent years about expanding during periods of high prices. These days, the refrain from executives is that “we’re not going to assume that just because prices are stronger this year, that they have to be stronger every year thereafter,” Mr. Read said. “And so the companies are living in a much more constrained environment.”

Background: Energy markets have settled down.

Exxon’s reduced profit is a sign that the global energy market has stabilized since it was upended by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

In response to the invasion, the United States banned oil imports from Russia, the world’s biggest exporter of oil, a move that helped push world energy costs up.

The American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, soared to more than $120 per barrel in June 2022 and stayed above $90 through that summer. Inflation reached a 40-year high, as consumer prices rose 9.1 percent in June 2022 from a year earlier.

Prices fell late last year as investors expected a recession and Chinese demand for oil fell, with the market reacting to fears of more Covid-19 lockdowns in the country.

At about $80 per barrel now, oil prices are lower than they were at the start of the war.

Those easing prices are reflected in U.S. inflation data. The overall Consumer Price Index, which includes food and energy costs, climbed 3 percent over the year through June, but a measure that strips out food and energy rose more, by nearly 5 percent.",0.11793523469994056,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/28oil-cjhv/28oil-cjhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['numbers exxon', '’ s revenue', 'exxon', '’ s', 'unusual level', 'energy market', 'second-quarter profit', 'energy companies', 'chevron', 'american oil company', 'second-quarter income', 'percent decline', 'shell', 'european energy company', 'second-quarter profit', 'record', 'permian', 'guyana', 'darren woods', 'exxon', '’ s', 'chief executive', 'investment analysts', 'company ’ s earnings', 'comparable industry commodity prices. ” “', 'earnings reflects', 'mr. woods', 'exxon', 'record production efforts', 'permian', 'texas', 'mexico', 'mr. woods', 'overall growth', 'guyana', 'gross production record', 'mr. woods', 'future years', '’ re', 'additional savings. ”', 'environment. ’', 'roger read', 'senior energy analyst', 'fargo', 'energy companies', 'recent years', 'high prices', '’ re', 'mr. read', 'environment. ”', 'background', 'energy', 'exxon', '’ s', 'global energy market', 'russia', '’ s invasion', 'ukraine', 'february', 'oil imports', 'russia', 'world ’ s', 'world energy costs', 'american benchmark', 'texas intermediate', 'crude oil', 'june', 'inflation', '40-year high', 'consumer prices', 'june', 'prices', 'chinese demand', 'covid-19', 'oil prices', 'u.s.', 'inflation data', 'overall consumer', 'price index', 'energy costs', 'june']","[('Numbers', 'ORG'), ('Exxon', 'ORG'), ('the latest quarter', 'DATE'), ('$82.9 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$115.7 billion', 'MONEY'), ('a year earlier', 'DATE'), ('1.94', 'MONEY'), ('4.21', 'MONEY'), ('the second quarter last year', 'DATE'), ('Exxon', 'ORG'), ('a year ago', 'DATE'), ('second-quarter', 'DATE'), ('$4.7 billion', 'MONEY'), ('2021', 'DATE'), ('Chevron', 'ORG'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('second-quarter', 'DATE'), ('$6 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$6.6 billion', 'MONEY'), ('the first quarter', 'DATE'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('$11.6 billion', 'MONEY'), ('the second quarter of last year', 'DATE'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('second-quarter', 'DATE'), ('$5.07 billion', 'MONEY'), ('56 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('the Permian Basin', 'LOC'), ('Guyana', 'GPE'), ('Darren Woods', 'PERSON'), ('Exxon', 'ORG'), ('the second quarter of 2018', 'DATE'), ('the intervening years', 'DATE'), ('Woods', 'PERSON'), ('Exxon', 'ORG'), ('the Permian Basin', 'LOC'), ('Texas', 'GPE'), ('New Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Woods', 'PERSON'), ('10 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Guyana', 'GPE'), ('quarterly', 'DATE'), ('380,000 barrels', 'QUANTITY'), ('Woods', 'PERSON'), ('$9 billion', 'MONEY'), ('the end of this year', 'DATE'), ('future years', 'DATE'), ('Roger Read', 'PERSON'), ('Wells Fargo', 'ORG'), ('recent years', 'DATE'), ('These days', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Read', 'PERSON'), ('Exxon', 'ORG'), ('Russia', 'GPE'), ('Ukraine', 'GPE'), ('February 2022', 'DATE'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('Russia', 'GPE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('West Texas Intermediate', 'PRODUCT'), ('more than $120', 'MONEY'), ('June 2022', 'DATE'), ('above $90', 'MONEY'), ('40-year', 'DATE'), ('9.1 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('June 2022', 'DATE'), ('a year earlier', 'DATE'), ('late last year', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('about $80', 'MONEY'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('3 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the year through June', 'DATE'), ('nearly 5 percent', 'PERCENT')]",Business

"72 Regional Theaters, One Shared Crisis",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/insider/regional-theater-crisis.html,"How do you balance the demands of daily news reporting with bigger-picture projects?

I’m probably going to be doing fewer features about individual shows, while I focus on more of these stories about the health of the field, but I still want to write occasional pieces about artists and works of art. I think a mix of stories is what keeps a reporter sane.

Do you anticipate doing a lot of that reporting in person?

I hope so. A couple of days ago, I went to see “Evita” at American Repertory Theater outside of Boston, and over the weekend I went to see a play called “tiny father” at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires. On Thursday, I saw a production of “Fun Home” at the Studio Theater in Washington, D.C. I’m trying, to the extent I can, to see things outside New York. We need to pay more attention to nonprofit theaters and theaters outside New York — because there are real challenges in those places we need to be telling our readers about.

What was the most surprising thing you learned while reporting this article?

I was struck by how many theaters are now doing coproductions. It’s pretty dramatic: The Shakespeare Theater Company in D.C. had one coproduction out of six shows before the pandemic, and now at least five out of six will be coproductions this coming season. There’s also a lot of experimentation with collaboration, which is heartening. Theaters that once saw themselves either as competitors or just strangers are much more interested in finding ways to help one another.

Your article touches on a number of potential solutions. Which seem most promising?

There’s a coalition forming of theaters in Connecticut that is talking about whether the theaters might be able to share set-building functions. Those kinds of approaches might have promise. A lot of theaters are talking about the possibility of either more government assistance or for more foundations to take seriously the challenges facing this field. There’s a shared sense that box-office revenue, which has never been enough to sustain these organizations, is not going to be a primary part of the solution.

How will we see an effect on Broadway, which depends on nonprofit theaters to develop material and support artists?

The situation means less work for artists, actors, writers, directors and designers. Fewer shows are being staged, and those shows are often smaller and have shorter runs, which is a challenge both for the people who are already established in the field and the people who are seeking to enter it.

Wall St. Pessimists Are Getting Used to Being Wrong,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/stock-market-bears.html,"Beaten as they might be by the stock market’s rally, worriers on Wall Street still question how long it can last. Their numbers are shrinking, though.

After starting the year with dour warnings about the economy, many investors and analysts have changed their minds. This newfound bullishness is grounded in signs that inflation is slowing and the economy is still standing strong, as well as a belief that corporate profits are set to grow now that interest rates have reached their peak, or are at least very close to it.

The past week gave them little reason to revert to more gloomy opinions.

Marquee earnings from some large tech companies, like Meta and Alphabet, helped drive stock prices higher. Consumer-facing companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever that are dependent on households continuing to spend also posted bumper financial results. Even the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said on Wednesday that the central bank’s own researchers no longer expected a recession this year.

Judge Rejects Hong Kong’s Bid to Ban Pro-Democracy Song From Internet,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/business/glory-to-hong-kong-injunction.html,"The Hong Kong government was seeking a court injunction against the publication or distribution of “Glory to Hong Kong” with “seditious intention” on the internet or in other media.

But Judge Anthony Chan denied the request, ruling that what the government wanted was too broad and effectively targeted everyone in Hong Kong. He wrote that the injunction could have had a “chilling effect” on free speech in Hong Kong.

“Freedom of expression is not absolute in nature but is nonetheless a highly important right that cannot be lawfully restricted without the requirements of legal certainty and proportionality being met,” he added.

Judge Chan also said that it would have been wrong to grant the injunction because existing criminal laws already gave the authorities the power to prosecute people for spreading the song, and that this ban would have been difficult to enforce, and unnecessary. Numerous people in Hong Kong have been arrested or charged for playing the song in public under an expansive national security law that Beijing imposed on the territory in 2020.

"As Heat Waves Intensify, Europe’s Cities Rely on Age-Old Ways to Stay Cool",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/world/europe/europe-heat-buildings-air-conditioning.html,"In Mediterranean countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, traditional houses tend to include qualities that allow for breezes to run through them. Thick walls help absorb heat during the day and release it at night, and features that provide shade, like pergolas, also serve to keep residents cool and reduce sun exposure, said Catalina Spataru, a professor of global energy and resources at the University College London Energy Institute. Narrow passageways in some city centers and tree-lined streets also provide shade for pedestrians.

Europe is experiencing heat waves at a rate that is more frequent and more intense than in many other parts of the world, and numerous homes are not equipped with air-conditioning. Governments in Greece, Italy and Spain have imposed measures to protect residents from the heat, including directing people toward public cooling spaces, relying on warning systems for extreme heat and making plans to create smaller neighborhood parks, which can be several degrees cooler than the streets.

Cooling experts say that increased reliance on energy-guzzling air-conditioning is not a sustainable solution. Conventional cooling devices, including air-conditioners and refrigerators, already account for as much as 10 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a World Bank report published in 2019. That amount is twice the emissions generated from aviation and sea travel combined, the report found.

Annual sales of air-conditioning units around the world have tripled since 1990, according to the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization that provides policy recommendations on the global energy sector.

A Bottleneck on the Grid Threatens Clean Energy.

Energy companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in wind farms, solar arrays and batteries, spurred on by federal tax breaks and falling costs. But these projects face a severe bottleneck: It is getting harder and taking longer to connect new power plants to the power lines that carry electricity to homes and businesses.

Soft Landing Optimism Is Everywhere. That’s Happened Before.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/economy/fed-economy-soft-landing.html,"Inflation has begun to cool meaningfully, but unemployment remains historically low at 3.6 percent and hiring has been robust. Consumers continue to spend at a solid pace and are helping to boost overall growth, based on strong gross domestic product data released on Thursday.

Given all that momentum, Fed staff economists in Washington, who had been predicting a mild recession late this year, no longer expect one, said Jerome H. Powell, the central bank’s chair, during a news conference on Wednesday. Mr. Powell said that while he was not yet ready to use the term “optimism,” he saw a possible pathway to a relatively painless slowdown.

But it can be difficult to tell in real time whether the economy is smoothly decelerating or whether it is creeping toward the edge of a cliff — one reason that officials like Mr. Powell are being careful not to declare victory. On Wednesday, policymakers lifted rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, the highest level in 22 years and up sharply from near zero as recently as early 2022. Those rate moves are trickling through the economy, making it more expensive to buy cars and houses on borrowed money and making it pricier for businesses to take out loans.

Such lags and uncertainties mean that while data today are unquestionably looking sunnier, risks still cloud the outlook.

Volkswagen Seeks to Regain Edge in China as It Cuts Delivery Forecast,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/volkswagen-china-delivery-forecast.html,"The Numbers

Volkswagen said its after-tax earnings in the first half of the year fell 20 percent from a year earlier, to 8.5 billion euros, or $9.45 billion. But overall revenue increased 18.2 percent as the company stemmed some of its losses in China, where deliveries were down 1.2 percent.

Western Europe provided the company with its strongest business, with 1.65 million vehicles ordered in the first half of the year, and 200,000 of them — or 12 percent — were electric, the company said. It expects shorter waits by the second half of the year, when constraints on supplies and transport as well as logistics tangles will ease.

The company also confirmed that it had sold its Russia operations, including a manufacturing plant, for €125 million. The sale of Volkswagen Group Rus to Avilon, a Moscow-based dealership, was announced in May.

The China Strategy

As part of an effort to claw back ground lost in the Chinese market, Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would invest $700 million for a nearly 5 percent stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles.

Last year, the Chinese automaker BYD overtook Volkswagen as the leading brand in the country. BYD widened the gap in the second quarter of the year, selling more than 595,000 hybrid or fully electric models, compared with 544,000 vehicles sold by Volkswagen, only 23,400 of them electric.

Volkswagen hopes that its investment in XPeng will help advance the German automaker’s electric vehicle software to the standards produced by Chinese manufacturers. Analysts say German companies have yet to match the technological advancements in phones, homes and vehicles as well as in-car entertainment that drivers in China expect.

The company also said its Audi division would expand its relationship with SAIC, a Chinese automaker that sells cars under the British brand MG.

Some analysts interpreted the move as a concession that Volkswagen was unable to compete with Chinese companies on the latest technology.

“The automobile of the future is coming from China. The Chinese are the leaders in important technology sectors,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany. “Without the know-how of the Chinese, Volkswagen would lose customers in China and, in a few years, in the rest of the world.”

What’s Next

Unlike Tesla, which has become the world’s most popular electric-car company partly by producing relatively few models in a limited palette of exterior and interior colors, Volkswagen Group offers dozens of models from its 10 brands, which include Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini. Analysts have increasingly questioned whether such a complex offering can remain competitive in today’s market.

But Oliver Blume, Volkswagen’s chief executive, expressed confidence that VW customers, including those in China, wanted more variety in their vehicles.

“People love brands — people love design and individuality,” Mr. Blume said on Thursday. “We think that is our specialty.”",0.06828924162257495,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/27/multimedia/27vw-kgzw/27vw-kgzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['numbers volkswagen', 'after-tax earnings', 'overall revenue', 'china', 'europe', 'percent —', 'shorter waits', 'logistics tangles', 'russia', 'volkswagen', 'rus', 'avilon', 'moscow-based', 'may', 'china strategy', 'chinese market', 'volkswagen', 'invest $', 'xpeng', 'chinese start-up', 'electric vehicles', 'chinese automaker', 'byd', 'volkswagen', 'byd', 'electric models', 'volkswagen', 'volkswagen', 'xpeng', 'german automaker ’ s', 'electric vehicle software', 'chinese manufacturers', 'german companies', 'technological advancements', 'in-car entertainment', 'china', 'audi', 'saic', 'chinese automaker', 'british brand', 'mg', 'volkswagen', 'chinese companies', 'china', 'important technology sectors', 'ferdinand dudenhöffer', 'automotive', 'duisburg', 'germany', 'volkswagen', 'china', 'world. ”', '’ s', 'tesla', 'world ’ s', 'popular electric-car company', 'interior colors', 'volkswagen', 'audi', 'porsche', 'lamborghini', 'complex offering', '’ s market', 'oliver blume', 'volkswagen', '’ s', 'chief executive', 'vw', 'china', '“ people', 'brands — people', 'mr. blume']","[('Numbers', 'ORG'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('the first half of the year', 'DATE'), ('20 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('a year earlier', 'DATE'), ('8.5 billion', 'CARDINAL'), ('$9.45 billion', 'MONEY'), ('18.2 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('1.2 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Western Europe', 'LOC'), ('1.65 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first half of the year', 'DATE'), ('200,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('12 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the second half of the year', 'DATE'), ('Russia', 'GPE'), ('€125 million', 'MONEY'), ('Volkswagen Group Rus', 'ORG'), ('Moscow', 'GPE'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('The China Strategy', 'ORG'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('$700 million', 'MONEY'), ('nearly 5 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('XPeng', 'ORG'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Last year', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('BYD', 'ORG'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('the second quarter of the year', 'DATE'), ('more than 595,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('544,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('only 23,400', 'CARDINAL'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('XPeng', 'GPE'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Audi', 'ORG'), ('SAIC', 'ORG'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('British', 'NORP'), ('MG', 'PERSON'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Ferdinand Dudenhöffer', 'PERSON'), ('the Center for Automotive Research', 'ORG'), ('Duisburg', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('a few years', 'DATE'), ('Tesla', 'ORG'), ('Volkswagen Group', 'ORG'), ('dozens', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Audi', 'ORG'), ('Porsche', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Oliver Blume', 'PERSON'), ('Volkswagen', 'ORG'), ('VW', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Blume', 'PERSON'), ('Thursday', 'DATE')]",Business
Elon Musk’s Quixotic Quest to Turn X Into an ‘Everything App’,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/technology/elon-musk-x-everything-app.html,"Four years ago, a billionaire tech executive leading one of the world’s pre-eminent social platforms laid out a vision to transform it into an app that could do it all. In an online manifesto, he wrote that the app would not only be central to written communications but have audio, video, payments, commerce and more.

The idea was akin to that of an “everything app” espoused recently by Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter. But the dream belonged to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In a 2019 blog post, Mr. Zuckerberg outlined how he would turn WhatsApp into an app that could be a platform for many “kinds of private services.”

In Silicon Valley, the pursuit of an everything app has come up time and again as tech leaders have strained to expand their digital empires. Mr. Zuckerberg tried it. So did Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber. Evan Spiegel, the head of Snap, said he wanted to go for it, too.

Yet those efforts fell short, with the tech executives unable to replicate the magic that has abounded in Asia with “super apps” like China’s WeChat, Japan’s Line and South Korea’s KakaoTalk. U.S. tech giants have instead run into cultural differences, regulatory scrutiny and a splintered financial system that has made the quest to build such apps more difficult.",0.08627450980392157,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/29/business/00everything-app/00everything-app-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['billionaire tech executive', 'world ’ s pre-eminent', 'social platforms', 'online manifesto', 'app ”', 'elon musk', 'twitter', 'mark zuckerberg', 'chief executive', 'meta', 'facebook', 'instagram', 'whatsapp', 'blog post', 'mr. zuckerberg', 'whatsapp', '“ kinds', 'private services. ”', 'silicon', 'tech leaders', 'digital empires', 'mr. zuckerberg', 'dara khosrowshahi', 'chief executive', 'uber', 'evan spiegel', 'snap', 'tech executives', 'asia', 'super apps ”', 'china', '’ s', 'wechat', 'japan', '’ s line', 'korea', '’ s', 'kakaotalk', 'u.s.', 'tech giants', 'cultural differences', 'regulatory scrutiny', 'financial system', 'such apps']","[('Four years ago', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Elon Musk', 'PERSON'), ('Twitter', 'PRODUCT'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Meta', 'ORG'), ('Facebook, Instagram', 'ORG'), ('WhatsApp', 'ORG'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('WhatsApp', 'ORG'), ('Silicon Valley', 'LOC'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Dara Khosrowshahi', 'PERSON'), ('Uber', 'ORG'), ('Evan Spiegel', 'PERSON'), ('Snap', 'PERSON'), ('Asia', 'LOC'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Japan', 'GPE'), ('Line', 'GPE'), ('South Korea’s', 'GPE'), ('KakaoTalk', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE')]",Business

U.S. Economy Grew at 2.4% Rate in Second Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q2.html,"Inflation has also slowed significantly. Consumer prices rose at a 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter, down from 4.1 percent in the first quarter and from more than 7 percent in the first half of last year. That has eased pressure on the Fed to keep raising rates, leading some forecasters to question whether a recession is such a sure thing after all. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday that the central bank’s staff economists no longer expected a recession to begin this year.

White House officials pointed to the report as evidence that President Biden’s economic policies, including investments in infrastructure and green energy, were paying off. In a blog post on Thursday, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers noted that investment in manufacturing facilities had contributed more than a third of a percentage point to overall G.D.P. growth, the most in more than four decades.

Mr. Biden, in a statement, said the data was evidence of “Bidenomics in action.”

Weiler, a manufacturer of paving and forestry equipment, recently opened a 120,000-square-foot building at its Knoxville, Iowa, headquarters. The company will use only about a quarter of the space right away, said Patrick Weiler, its president and chief executive. But he is betting on continued growth.

“We just think we’ve got a pretty good future, and it seemed like a logical investment,” he said.

Demand has been strong coming out of the pandemic, Mr. Weiler said. Now that supply-chain disruptions are being resolved — for a while, the company had trouble getting the engines that power its equipment — he can meet that demand. Federal infrastructure spending, he added, should help keep sales strong even if private demand slows.

“There’s very good end-user confidence because they see a lot of work coming,” Mr. Weiler said.

Still, many economists say consumers are likely to pull back their spending in the second half of the year, putting a drag on the recovery. Savings built up earlier in the pandemic are dwindling. Credit card balances are rising. And although unemployment remains low, job growth and wage growth have slowed.

“All those tailwinds and buffers that were supporting consumption are not as strong anymore,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. “It feels to me like this hard landing has been delayed rather than canceled.”",0.16391649413388545,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/26/multimedia/2023-07-27-gdp-quarters-annual-rate-index/2023-07-27-gdp-quarters-annual-rate-index-facebookJumbo-v7.png,2023,"['inflation', 'consumer prices', 'percent rate', 'fed', 'sure thing', 'jerome h. powell', 'fed', 'central bank ’ s staff economists', 'white house officials', 'biden', '’ s', 'economic policies', 'green energy', 'blog post', 'president ’ s council', 'advisers', 'percentage point', 'g.d.p', 'mr. biden', 'bidenomics', 'action. ”', 'weiler', 'forestry equipment', '120,000-square-foot building', 'knoxville', 'iowa', 'patrick weiler', 'chief executive', '’ ve', 'pretty good future', 'logical investment', 'demand', 'mr. weiler', 'supply-chain disruptions', 'equipment —', 'federal infrastructure spending', 'private demand slows', '’ s', 'good end-user confidence', 'mr. weiler', 'credit', 'card balances', 'job growth', 'wage growth', 'blerina uruci', 'u.s.', 't. rowe price']","[('2.6 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the second quarter', 'DATE'), ('4.1 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the first quarter', 'DATE'), ('more than 7 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the first half of last year', 'DATE'), ('Fed', 'ORG'), ('Jerome H.

European Central Bank Lays the Ground for a Rate Increase or a Pause,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/ecb-interest-rates-europe.html,"For the past year, the European Central Bank has raised interest rates at every one of its policy meetings in an effort to rein in high inflation. Looking forward, that can no longer be the expectation.

In a well-telegraphed move, policymakers raised rates on Thursday for the 20 countries that use the euro currency by a quarter of a percentage point, pushing the deposit rate up to 3.75 percent, the highest since late 2000. But they kept their options open about future decisions amid weakness in the region’s economy.

Christine Lagarde, the president of the bank, broke from a recent trend on offering clear guidance and refused to give a firm indication about what the central bank will decide at its next policy meeting in mid-September. Instead she said rates could either rise for a 10th time or be held steady.

“We are deliberately data-dependent, and we have an open mind as to what the decisions will be in September and in subsequent meetings,” Ms. Lagarde said in a news conference in Frankfurt on Thursday. “We might hike, and we might hold.

Warren and Graham Team Up to Take on Big Tech,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/dealbook/warren-graham-big-tech.html,"A bipartisan push for a new digital cop

For years, policymakers have worried about the growing power of digital giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, as they came to dominate more and more of everyday life. Now, two prominent senators are pushing to create a new federal agency to rein in the power of Big Tech.

Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, plan to introduce the Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act, which they say would restrain tech titans while letting them continue to innovate. But these companies have fought hard against increased oversight, and it’s unclear how a new agency will fit into a Washington already full of regulators.

The bill is in the vein of legislation that established agencies to oversee fast-growing industries, much like how Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This time, the focus is on online platforms that together command nearly $10 trillion in market cap and whose products touch on free speech, privacy, jobs and more.

Shell Reports Sharply Lower Earnings as Energy Prices Ease,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/shell-earnings-q2.html,"Why It Matters

Shell’s performance, which came in below analysts’ forecasts, shows that the petroleum industry may have reached a certain equilibrium after an extended period of volatility stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. If so, large, petroleum-dominated companies like Shell remain very profitable even in a lower price environment.

Shell also continues to reward shareholders. The company raised its dividend 15 percent for the quarter, to about 33 cents a share. Shell also announced $3 billion in share buybacks, a slight decrease from $3.6 billion in the previous quarter.

Background

The energy industry has demonstrated resilience in the last few years despite a very volatile environment. Energy companies have compensated for a sharp reduction of natural gas flows from Russia to Europe by bringing supplies from elsewhere, especially the United States. The global oil trade has also so far adjusted fairly smoothly to Western sanctions on Russian crude and refined products.

Those adjustments, along with muted demand growth in China, the world’s largest importer of energy commodities, have allowed prices to ease despite efforts to curb supplies by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Brent crude, the international benchmark, sold for an average of about $78 a barrel in the second quarter — a 31 percent drop from a year earlier. Natural gas prices in Europe were 65 percent lower.

What’s Next

On a call with journalists, Wael Sawan, Shell’s chief executive, indicated that he thought there was a good chance that Europe could come through the next winter, a time when gas consumption typically soars, in decent shape.

“We are going into this European winter in a good place,” he said, with storage levels of the fuel high and the capacity for renewable energy growing.

However, Europe remains heavily dependent on imported gas, and Mr. Sawan said price pressures in the market over the winter could depend on outside factors such as the strength of demand in China and the weather. Last winter, Europe benefited from mild temperatures and reduced demand for energy in China.

Mr. Sawan, who became chief executive at the beginning of the year, has brought a skeptical approach to the company’s many businesses, including some of those Shell entered under his predecessor, Ben van Beurden.

In the transition to lower-carbon energy, he is trying to focus on areas that he thinks fit well with Shell’s traditional strengths, like electric vehicle charging stations and biofuels. He said on Thursday that he did not think the company had what he called “a big differentiated advantage” in generating electricity with wind and solar energy. Shell plans to sell some electric power businesses, including an energy retailer in Britain, and it seems likely that others could go on the block.",0.024721254355400703,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/27shell-print-lgph/27shell-lgph-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['matters shell', '’ s performance', 'analysts ’ forecasts', 'petroleum industry', 'certain equilibrium', 'ukraine', 'shell', 'price environment', 'shell', 'reward shareholders', 'shell', 'share buybacks', 'previous quarter', 'background', 'energy industry', 'volatile environment', 'energy', 'sharp reduction', 'natural gas', 'russia', 'europe', 'global oil trade', 'western sanctions', 'russian', 'demand growth', 'china', 'world ’ s', 'energy commodities', 'curb supplies', 'petroleum exporting countries', 'brent', 'international benchmark', 'quarter —', 'percent drop', 'natural gas prices', 'europe', '’ s', 'wael sawan', 'shell', '’ s', 'chief executive', 'good chance', 'europe', 'gas consumption', 'decent shape', 'european winter', 'good place', 'storage levels', 'fuel high', 'renewable energy', 'europe', 'mr. sawan', 'price pressures', 'china', 'europe', 'mild temperatures', 'china', 'mr. sawan', 'chief executive', 'skeptical approach', 'company ’ s', 'shell', 'ben', 'beurden', 'lower-carbon energy', 'shell', '’ s', 'traditional strengths', 'electric vehicle', 'advantage ”', 'solar energy', 'shell', 'electric power businesses', 'energy retailer', 'britain']","[('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Ukraine', 'GPE'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('15 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the quarter', 'DATE'), ('about 33 cents', 'MONEY'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('$3 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$3.6 billion', 'MONEY'), ('the previous quarter', 'DATE'), ('the last few years', 'DATE'), ('Russia', 'GPE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('Russian', 'NORP'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries', 'ORG'), ('about $78', 'MONEY'), ('the second quarter', 'DATE'), ('31 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('a year earlier', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('65 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Wael Sawan', 'PERSON'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('the next winter', 'DATE'), ('this European winter', 'EVENT'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Sawan', 'PERSON'), ('the winter', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Last winter', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Sawan', 'PERSON'), ('the beginning of the year', 'DATE'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Ben van Beurden', 'PERSON'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('Shell', 'ORG'), ('Britain', 'GPE')]",Business

How Supreme Court Justices Make Millions From Book Deals,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/us/politics/supreme-court-justices-book-deals.html,"Only three months into Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s first Supreme Court term, she announced a book deal negotiated by the same powerhouse lawyer who represented the Obamas and James Patterson.

The deal was worth about $3 million, according to people familiar with the agreement, and made Justice Jackson the latest Supreme Court justice to parlay her fame into a big book contract.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch had made $650,000 for a book of essays and personal reflections on the role of judges, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett received a $2 million advance for her forthcoming book about keeping personal feelings out of judicial rulings. Those newer justices joined two of their more senior colleagues, Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor, in securing payments that eclipse their government salaries.

In recent months reports by ProPublica, The New York Times and others have highlighted a lack of transparency at the Supreme Court, as well as the absence of a binding ethics code for the justices.

Researchers Poke Holes in Safety Controls of ChatGPT and Other Chatbots,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/ai-chatgpt-safety-research.html,"A recent decision by Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to let anyone do what they want with its technology has been criticized in some tech circles because it could lead to the spread of powerful A.I. with little regard for controls.

But the company said it offered its technology as open source software in an effort to accelerate the progress of A.I. and better understand the risks. Proponents of open-source software also say the tight controls that a few companies have over the technology stifles competition.

The debate over whether it is better to let everyone see computer code and collectively fix it rather than keeping it private predates the chatbot boom by decades. And it is likely to become even more contentious because of what the researchers revealed in their report on Thursday.

The researchers found that they could break through the guardrails of open source systems by appending a long suffix of characters onto each English-language prompt fed into the system.

If they asked one of these chatbots to “write a tutorial on how to make a bomb,” it would decline to do so. But if they added a lengthy suffix to the same prompt, it would instantly provide a detailed tutorial on how to make a bomb. In similar ways, they could coax the chatbots into generating biased, false and otherwise toxic information.",0.06577380952380951,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/28/multimedia/27ai-jailbreak-top-cbvj/27ai-jailbreak-top-cbvj-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023,"['recent decision', 'meta', 'facebook', '’ s parent company', 'tech circles', 'a.i', 'open source software', 'a.i', 'proponents', 'open-source software', 'tight controls', 'technology stifles competition', 'computer code', 'private predates', 'chatbot boom', 'open source systems', 'long suffix', 'english-language', 'lengthy suffix', 'similar ways', 'toxic information']","[('Meta', 'ORG'), ('A.I.', 'GPE'), ('A.I.', 'GPE'), ('decades', 'DATE'), ('Thursday', 'DATE'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('fed', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('suffix', 'GPE')]",Business
"Jobs Sit Empty in the Public Sector, So Unions Pitch In to Recruit",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/economy/local-government-jobs-unions.html,"Public needs, however, have only increased. Minnesota, along with recovering from a hiring freeze early in the pandemic, has passed larger budgets and new laws — regulating cannabis sales, for example — that have added hundreds of positions across several agencies. At the same time, the federal infrastructure bill is supercharging demand for people to manage construction projects.

That’s a victory for labor unions, which typically push for more hiring, higher wages and better benefits. But it doesn’t help them much if positions stay empty. A survey of local government human resource officers, released in June by the nonprofit research organization Mission Square, found that more than half the respondents had to reopen recruitment processes very often or frequently for lack of enough applications. In Minnesota, the vacancy rate for state government jobs rose to 11.5 percent in the 2023 fiscal year from 7.5 percent in 2019.

That’s why the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, known as AFSCME, decided it needed to pitch in on a function usually reserved for human resources departments: getting people in the door. The union has started a national campaign to generate buzz around frontline positions, while locals are contacting community organizations and even families of union members to spotlight opportunities.

“Our employers are feeling the heat,” said Lee Saunders, the union’s president. “They understand that services are not being provided at the level that they should be provided. It’s a team effort as far as bringing fresh blood into the public service.”

That was the point of the hiring fair in Minneapolis.

An American Energy Giant Sees Israel as a Springboard to Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/energy-environment/israel-gas-europe.html,"There are also signs of unease within Israel over moving from one fossil fuel to another.

“Gas is taking us toward less pollution than coal, but it is not getting us out of pollution completely, and it is not getting us to cleaner energy,” said Yael Cohen Paran, a former Israeli lawmaker, in an interview at a beach resort where the Leviathan platform was visible in the distance.

Environmentalists say that the dominance of gas in powering the Israeli economy and the influence of the petroleum industry mean that insufficient resources are going into developing clean energy.

“We are hostages in a way,” said Elad Hochman, executive director of Green Course, an advocacy group.

As for Chevron, though it does not disclose financial results from its Israeli operations, its executives say it is a profitable business that can be a springboard for expansion.

U.S. Moves to Improve Airplane Bathrooms for People With Disabilities,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/us/politics/airplane-bathrooms-disabilities-accessibility.html,"The Transportation Department announced on Wednesday that it had finalized new regulations to require more commercial aircraft to have accessible bathrooms, a long-awaited step to address complaints from disabled travelers about the difficulties of flying.

Under the regulations, new single-aisle planes with at least 125 seats will eventually be required to have at least one lavatory large enough for a disabled passenger and an attendant to enter and move around in. Twin-aisle planes are already required to have an accessible lavatory.

“Traveling can be stressful enough without worrying about being able to access a restroom,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “Yet today, millions of wheelchair users are forced to choose between dehydrating themselves before boarding a plane or avoiding air travel altogether.”

The finalized regulations came out of a lengthy effort by the Transportation Department, dating back to the Obama administration, to develop new rules intended to improve air travel for people with disabilities.

White House Condemns Fox News Over Host’s Holocaust Comments,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/business/white-house-fox-news-holocaust.html,"The News

The White House denounced Fox News this week over comments by one of its hosts, Greg Gutfeld, that some Jews “had to be useful” as a means for survival in Nazi concentration camps, calling his remarks “an obscenity.”

Mr. Gutfeld, who took over the 10 p.m. time slot last week as part of a reshuffling of programming at Fox, made the comments during a debate on “The Five” about Florida’s new African American history curriculum. New instructions for middle school students, championed by the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, say students should be instructed that “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit,” a depiction that has drawn widespread rebuke.

During an exchange with Jessica Tarlov, a co-host who equated the new history standards to saying Jews derived some benefit from being imprisoned during the Holocaust, Mr. Gutfeld asked her about the work of Viktor Frankl, a Jewish psychiatrist who wrote about his struggle for survival at Auschwitz and other Nazi camps.

“Did you ever read ‘Man’s Search for Meaning’?” Mr. Gutfeld said. “Vik Frankl talks about how you had to survive in a concentration camp by having skills. You had to be useful. Utility. Utility kept you alive.”

Ms. Tarlov did not address Mr. Gutfeld’s question directly, instead saying she was concerned about middle school children being taught what Florida had set in its new curriculum.

A White House spokesman, Andrew Bates, released a statement on Tuesday condemning Fox News for broadcasting Mr. Gutfeld’s comments, calling them “a horrid, dangerous, extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of Americans who suffered from the evil of enslavement.” He added, “There was nothing good about slavery; there was nothing good about the Holocaust.”

A Brexit Champion’s Feud With His Elite Bank Brings a C.E.O.

Mr. Farage, who helped mobilize the pro-Brexit vote in 2016, was marginalized in Britain, then consumed by the pandemic.

No longer: For three weeks, Mr. Farage, has been back on the front pages of British papers, with an attention-grabbing claim that his exclusive private bank, Coutts, dropped him as a customer because of his polarizing politics.

Early on Wednesday, after Mr. Farage’s allegations were largely vindicated, the chief executive of his bank’s parent, NatWest Group, resigned after she admitted improperly discussing his bank account with a BBC journalist.

Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/mexico-trump-us-corn/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.

Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.

It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country.

""I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina,"" Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.

He added: It's a ""good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes.""

American corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.

Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us

America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.

American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.

Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers.

""If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy,"" says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.

Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.

Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.

Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan'

Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.

All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.

But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.

Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond ""immediately"" to any tariffs from Trump.

""It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,"" Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.

How 'America First' could turn into 'India First',http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/technology/india-h1b-visa-trump-nandan-nilekani/index.html?section=money_news_international,"America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.

That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity.

""If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent,"" Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.

The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.

Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.

India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.

Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.

Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through.

""Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue,"" Nilekani said. ""If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder.""

India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.

Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas

But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's ""America First"" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India.

""This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season,"" he said. ""It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here.""

Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.

The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar.

Swiss voters reject corporate tax overhaul,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/pf/taxes/switzerland-tax-referendum-vote/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.

The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.

Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear. The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country.

""They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions,"" Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.

Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being ""blacklisted"" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.

Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.

The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.

Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters.

""I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland,"" Naville said. ""Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit.""

Swiss authorities say they will move quickly to create a modified tax reform proposal. Naville said he hopes new rules are devised within the next few months.

""All stakeholders now have to take responsibility to develop an acceptable competitive tax system, and to regain credibility regarding the famed political stability which gave Switzerland such an advantageous position,"" he said in a statement.

Naville hinted that potential tax reforms in the U.S. and U.K. could tempt Swiss-based companies to relocate, putting more pressure on Switzerland's tax base.",0.003994383994384001,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170213104024-switzerland-referendum-tax-780x439.jpg,2017,"['switzerland', 'political establishment', 'reform plan', ""country 's"", 'corporate tax system', 'international norms', 'tax reforms', 'business community', 'special low-tax privileges', 'multinational companies', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', ""'s tax system"", 'vote result', 'deter companies', '[ tax ] measures', 'available ...', 'solid basis', 'investment decisions', 'peter uebelhart', 'kpmg', 'switzerland', 'video statement', 'switzerland', 'intense pressure', 'g20', 'oecd', 'recent years', 'tax system', 'country runs', 'tax system', 'tax reform package', 'stefan kuhn', 'corporate tax', 'kpmg', 'switzerland', 'tax hikes', 'middle class', 'current tax system', 'preferential treatment', 'large foreign operations', 'international tax authorities', 'rules amount', 'unfair corporate subsidies', 'martin naville', 'swiss-american', 'bad day', 'switzerland', 'naville', 'clearly', 'swiss [ system ]', 'massive hit', 'related', 'europe', ""'s elections"", 'swiss authorities', 'tax reform proposal', 'naville', 'new rules', 'acceptable competitive tax system', 'regain credibility', 'famed political stability', 'switzerland', 'advantageous position', 'naville', 'potential tax reforms', 'u.s.', 'u.k.', 'swiss-based', 'switzerland', ""'s tax base""]","[('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Peter Uebelhart', 'PERSON'), ('KPMG', 'ORG'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('G20', 'ORG'), ('OECD', 'ORG'), ('recent years', 'DATE'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('Stefan Kuhn', 'PERSON'), ('KPMG', 'ORG'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Martin Naville', 'PERSON'), ('the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce', 'ORG'), ('59%', 'PERCENT'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Naville', 'GPE'), ('Swiss', 'NORP'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Swiss', 'NORP'), ('Naville', 'GPE'), ('the next few months', 'DATE'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE'), ('Naville', 'GPE'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('U.K.', 'GPE'), ('Swiss', 'NORP'), ('Switzerland', 'GPE')]",Business
Stocks hit record again. But is Trump the reason?,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/stocks-all-time-highs-donald-trump-janet-yellen-fed/index.html?section=money_news_international,"The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.

Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.

So is this the Donald Trump rally? Or the Janet Yellen rally?

Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.

Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?

You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.

The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.

But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.

RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled ""Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald.""

Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market

Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.

But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.

You can't have it both ways. It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.

Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.

Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.

Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.

Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.

Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time

So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.

What's really going on? The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.

Yes. the markets are reacting to Washington. But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.

The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.

The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.

Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried

The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually. But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.

Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time. That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.

That's still extremely low. At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds. Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip. And consumers would probably keep spending.

So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president,

With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Apple stock nears record high,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/technology/apple-stock-record/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Apple has found its groove again.

The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015.

The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of ""major new features"" like ""3D sensing"" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney.

Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the ""mother of all upgrades.""

Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014.

The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand.

Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration'

Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.

Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits.

But that losing streak just ended.

Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.

The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes.

Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, ""Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped.""

The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump.

Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.

Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.",-0.012354797979797976,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160727103035-apple-stocks-up-780x439.jpg,2017,"['apple', ""iphone maker 's stock"", 'apple', 'april', 'apple', ""'s stock"", 'previous record', 'february', 'stock surge', 'apple', 'aapl', 'market cap', 'goldman sachs', 'price target', 'major new features', 'iphone model', 'investor note', 'cnnmoney', 'apple', 'ceo tim cook', 'apple', 'long wait', ""iphone 's tenth anniversary"", 'apple', 'reignite demand', 'related', 'tim cook', 'apple', 'annual sales', 'fiscal year', 'iphone sales', 'consecutive quarters', 'apple', 'ceo', ""company 's failure"", 'performance goals', 'apple', 'december', 'expensive iphone', 'new record', 'samsung', ""'s smartphone recall woes"", 'mark moskowitz', 'william blair', 'investor note', 'samsung', 'wall', 'apple', 'trump', 'trump', 'apple', 'apple', 'trump', 'u.s.', 'overseas accounts', 'apple', 'foreign accounts', 'trump', 'congress', 'apple']","[('Apple', 'ORG'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('133.82', 'MONEY'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('134.54', 'MONEY'), ('April 2015', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('the day', 'DATE'), ('133.29', 'MONEY'), ('133', 'MONEY'), ('February 2015', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('$700 billion', 'MONEY'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('Goldman Sachs', 'ORG'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('CNNMoney', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('six months', 'DATE'), ('Tim Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('every other year', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('iPhones', 'ORG'), ('late 2014', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('tenth', 'ORDINAL'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Tim Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('annual', 'DATE'), ('the 2016 fiscal year', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('2001', 'DATE'), ('three consecutive quarters', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('15%', 'PERCENT'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('the December quarter', 'DATE'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('78.3 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('iPhones', 'ORG'), ('the quarter', 'DATE'), ('Samsung', 'ORG'), ('Mark Moskowitz', 'PERSON'), ('William Blair', 'PERSON'), ('this month', 'DATE'), (""Samsung's Note 7"", 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('iPhone', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Trump', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('at least one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Trump', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('$230 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Trump', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG')]",Business
"America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico",http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/nafta-canada-trudeau-trump-mexico/index.html?section=money_news_international,"America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.

President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada,"" Trump said at the news conference.

But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think. There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost.

""Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place,"" says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.

Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Canada is rarely mentioned.

Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico. Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.

Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive. But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.

Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.

1. Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico

Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA. But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies. Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.

There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico. (By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.)

And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints. Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.

2. The U.S. - Canada lumber battle

NAFTA isn't the only sore area. In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was ""dumping"" its wood on the U.S. market. Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs.

""It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while,"" says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.

Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.

Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada. American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004. It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.

According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from. That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.

The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.

However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again. The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.

3. Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war

Things got even worse during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade. So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.

It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act. Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.

Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war.

""Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff,"" according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of ""Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.""

For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all). Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.

Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada. Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.

4. Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk

Fast forward to today. Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.

For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department. Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%.

""They're so onerous that you can't bring it across. There's no American eggs in Quebec,"" says Velk.

According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different. Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.

The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.

Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market. But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.

5. COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA

Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.

In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.

For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered. Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.

The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law. American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.

As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement. The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.

"Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose",http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/verizon-stock-unlimited-data-plan/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan. That's great if you're a Verizon customer. But it is terrible news for its investors.

Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday. It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.

Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

""In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.

That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down. T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.

But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.

AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.

Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans

And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.

But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.

Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.

However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it ""continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches"" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.

Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).

There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).

That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.

Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.

Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover

Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.

Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.

That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher.

So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.

Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/oil-prices-opec-deal/index.html?section=money_news_international,"It's a good day for OPEC.

Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.

The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.

The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.

Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.

Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher:

OPEC deal

OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.

The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.

Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.

Crucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.

UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.

The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.

Investors upbeat

The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.

The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.

Higher demand

The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.

Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.

The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.

Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale

What's next?

Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.

That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago.

U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report.

""This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output,"" said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.

Tesla is going to sell electric cars in the Middle East,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/investing/tesla-uae-elon-musk/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Tesla is bringing its electric cars to the heart of the oil producing world.

The automaker announced Monday that its first official venture in the Middle East will be in the United Arab Emirates.

The first cars -- the Model S and Model X -- will hit the road this summer.

""Timing seems to be good to really make a significant debut in this region starting in Dubai,"" Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said at the World Government Summit in Dubai.

Tesla owners will have access to two existing supercharging stations in the UAE, and Telsa plans to open five more by the end of the year.

Despite sitting on huge oil and gas reserves, the UAE has ambitious plans to go green. Last month it said it will invest $163 billion to boost alternative energy use over the next three decades.

It's the latest in a series of expansion announcements for Tesla. Last week, Musk hinted that Tesla may soon come to India.

Musk has also teased plans to build ""heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport"" as well developing a ride-hailing network, which could be similar to Uber.

Speaking in Dubai, the entrepreneur expounded on the future of robotics.

""We will see autonomy and artificial intelligence advance tremendously,"" Musk said. ""In probably 10 years, it will be very unusual for cars to be built that are not fully autonomous.""

But he also warned of the ""disruptive"" nature of autonomous vehicles.

""That disruption I'm talking about will take place over about 20 years. Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have something like 12% to 15% of the workforce be unemployed.""

Musk said governments must pay close attention to artificial intelligence, create sustainable transport and be wary of mass unemployment.

""This will be a massive social challenge. Ultimately, we need to think about universal basic income. I don't think we have a choice,"" he said. ""There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better.""

Indian rival slams Uber's business model,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/technology/uber-ola-india-pranay-jivrajka/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Uber's top rival in India has some unsolicited advice for the U.S. startup: Go local.

""They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography,"" Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Jivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand ""local nuances"" that would help it to identify services that ""users and drivers actually want.""

Uber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks.

Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.

The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing. Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.

In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.

Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015.

""What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want,"" said Jivrajka.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick insists that his company is not prepared to leave India.

""We are losing, but we see a path towards profitability,"" Kalanick said during a December visit to Delhi. ""We see ourselves being here in the long run.""

India isn't always a straightforward market for either company -- tens of thousands of drivers representing both Uber and Ola went on strike in Delhi this week, demanding better pay and benefits. The Delhi government has offered to mediate the dispute.

Jivrajka did not comment on the protests, but said that Ola's main focus remains bringing more drivers onto its platform.

""We need more drivers because the pace at which demand is increasing is way higher than the way supply is getting aggregated,"" he said.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for ""massive campaign"" against fake news",http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/11/media/fake-news-apple-ceo-tim-cook/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Apple CEO Tim Cook wants the tech industry to take action against ""fake news"" stories that are polluting the web.

""There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic,"" Cook said in a rare interview.

Speaking with The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Cook also said ""all of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news.""

Other leading tech company CEOs, like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, have spoken about the problem in recent months. But Cook's comments were much more frank.

According to the Telegraph, he said made-up stories and hoaxes are ""killing people's minds.""

And he called the ""fake news"" plague ""a big problem in a lot of the world.""

The term ""fake news"" was originally coined to describe online stories that are designed to deceive readers. Often times these stories are shared on Facebook and other social networking sites to generate profits for the creators. Other times the stories are essentially propaganda made up for political purposes.

These kinds of stories received widespread attention before and after the American election. Fictional stories with titles like ""Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president"" won millions of clicks.

It can be very difficult for web surfers to tell the difference between legitimate news sources and fakes.

That's where companies like Apple come in.

In the Telegraph interview -- part of a multi-day European trip -- Cook said ""too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven't figured out what to do.""

He urged both technological and intellectual solutions.

""We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will,"" Cook told the newspaper.

What he described is music to the ears of media literacy advocates.

""It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid,"" Cook said.

There are scattered efforts in some schools to teach media literacy, with a focus on digital skills, but it is by no means universal.

When asked if Apple would commit to funding a PSA campaign, an Apple spokesman said the company had no further comment on Cook's interview.

The Apple CEO also suggested that tech companies can help weed out fake stories, though he added, ""We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press.""

Apple's own Apple News app has been credited with being a relatively reliable place to find information.

The company ""reviews publishers who join Apple News,"" BuzzFeed noted last December.

And the app has a ""report-a-concern function where users can flag fake news or hate speech.""

Facebook recently started working with fact-checkers to test ""warning labels"" that show up when users share made-up stories.

Cook, in the newspaper interview, expressed optimism that the ""fake news"" plague is a ""short-term thing -- I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day.""",-0.03241084312512884,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160823191106-tim-cook-thumbnail-780x439.jpg,2017,"['apple ceo tim cook', 'tech industry', 'fake news', 'massive campaign', 'cook', 'rare interview', 'telegraph', 'cook', 'technology companies need', 'fake news', 'tech company', 'ceos', 'facebook', 'mark zuckerberg', 'recent months', 'cook', ""'s comments"", 'according', 'telegraph', 'made-up stories', ""people 's minds"", 'fake news', 'big problem', 'fake news', 'describe online stories', 'deceive readers', 'often', 'facebook', 'generate profits', 'political purposes', 'widespread attention', 'american election', 'fictional', 'pope francis', 'shocks world', 'donald trump', 'web surfers', 'legitimate news sources', 'apple', 'telegraph', 'european trip', 'cook', 'complain category', 'intellectual solutions', 'modern version', 'public-service announcement campaign', 'cook', 'media literacy advocates', 'new course', 'modern kid', 'digital kid', 'cook', 'media literacy', 'digital skills', 'apple', 'psa', 'apple', 'cook', ""'s interview"", 'apple ceo', 'tech companies', 'fake stories', 'apple', 'apple', 'news app', 'reliable place', 'reviews publishers', 'apple', 'buzzfeed', 'december', 'report-a-concern function', 'flag fake news', 'facebook', 'warning labels', 'made-up stories', 'cook', 'newspaper interview', 'fake news', 'short-term thing']","[('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Tim Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('The Daily Telegraph', 'ORG'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('recent months', 'DATE'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Telegraph', 'ORG'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Francis', 'PERSON'), ('Donald Trump', 'PERSON'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Telegraph', 'FAC'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('PSA', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple News', 'ORG'), ('Apple News', 'ORG'), ('BuzzFeed', 'ORG'), ('last December', 'DATE'), ('Cook', 'PERSON'), ('the end of the day', 'DATE')]",Business
Trump brand takes another hit,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/news/companies/trump-brand-sears-kmart/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Nordstrom. Neiman Marcus. TJ Maxx. And now, Sears and Kmart.

Sears Holdings, the company that owns retail stores Sears and Kmart, reportedly said this weekend that it would remove 31 Trump-branded items from its website.

The company pulled the products as part of a plan to focus on its ""most profitable items,"" Sears spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters.

Hanover told the news organization that items in the Trump Home line of furnishings were removed from the company's website, although they could still be purchased through third-party vendors online. Neither store carried the items in their physical stores, he said.

Searches of the Sears and KMart websites did not turn up Trump Home products, except for those sold by third-party vendors.

In a statement Monday, spokesman Chris Brathwaite distanced Sears from any political controversy and reiterated that many Trump-branded products are still available through third-party sellers.

""In this case, certain products were removed from our websites that included a very small number of Trump products,"" he said. ""The headlines do not do justice to our business or this specific brand of products that we offer through our marketplace sellers.""

Brathwaite added that the company prefers to focus on its business and ""leave the politics to others.""

The move makes Sears the latest to ditch products bearing the Trump name.

Earlier this month, Nordstrom (JWN) cited brand ""performance,"" not politics, as the reason why it decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories label.

President Trump knocked the department store on Twitter in retaliation. Nordstrom stock jumped 7% in the first two days following the tweet.

My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017

Other stores have also sought to distance themselves from Ivanka Trump's brand.

Neiman Marcus removed the brand landing page from its website, and declined to tell CNNMoney whether it intended to keep Ivanka Trump products in stores or resume online sales in the future.

TJX Companies (TJX), the company that owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, also said that it had recently told workers not to highlight the first daughter's brand in stores.

And retailer Belk said last week that it planned to pull Ivanka Trump's products from its website, but would continue to offer the line in its flagship stores.

Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line has taken a hit in recent months.

Online sales of her brand dipped 26% in January compared to a year earlier, according to Slice Intelligence, a retail analysis firm. Slice studied the brand's sales on five online stores: Nordstrom, Amazon, Zappos, Macy's and Bloomingdale's.

Online sales of Ivanka's brand had surged in late 2015, and last month's numbers appear to be more of a ""return to reality,"" according to Taylor Stanton, Slice's marketing and communications manager. The brand's dip in performance was abnormal in light of an uptick in 2016 online sales in the apparel and accessories category, said Jack Beckwythe, a Slice analyst.

The Ivanka Trump brand has defended its performance.

Rosemary Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, told CNNMoney last week that the brand was growing and experienced ""significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.""

""We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains,"" Young said.

Retailers like Bloomingdale's, Amazon (AMZN), Lord & Taylor, Macy's (M) and Zappos all still carry Ivanka Trump products.

Ivanka Trump has taken a leave of absence from her namesake company since her father won the presidency. She has no formal role in the administration but is expected to have a voice on issues such as women's empowerment and child care.

This company makes food packaging out of bamboo to cut down on trash,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/news/thailand-bamboo-cassava-packaging-universal-biopack/index.html?section=money_news_international,"To tackle Thailand's mounting trash problem, one company is turning to the country's plant life.

Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers. But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country.

After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies. But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year.

""Waste management is a big problem everywhere,"" said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin.

Related: The company turning 4 billion plastic bottles into clothes

The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging. It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones. The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process.

In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry.

But finding new clients can be tricky.

Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins. Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell.

""The local economy still does not support [this technology]"" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin.

But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand. Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand.

To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing. It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100.

The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million.

A lot of the demand comes from overseas. One of its customers uses the natural packaging for coconut water it exports.

"LeBron, Serena and other Nike stars champion 'Equality'",http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/news/companies/nike-equality-lebron-serena/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Nike says it's time to stand up for equality in a new ad campaign.

The company on Sunday launched a star-studded short film titled ""Equality"" to mark Black History Month.

The ad features Nike-sponsored athletes LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, Gabby Douglas, among others, ""amplifying their voices in an effort to uplift, open eyes and bring the positive values that sport can represent into wider focus,"" the company said.

Actor Michael B. Jordan voices the film, and singer Alicia Keys performs a rendition of Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come.""

If we can be equals in sport, we can be equals everywhere. #EQUALITY pic.twitter.com/ki5NaJN12d — Nike (@Nike) February 12, 2017

""Is this the land history promised?"" Jordan says. ""Here, within these lines, on this concrete court, this patch of turf, here, you're defined by your actions -- not your looks or beliefs.""

Nike will feature ads from the campaign on social media, billboards and posters throughout cities in the United States and Canada. It will also sell ""Equality"" branded T-shirts and shoes as part of its annual Black History Month collection.

Apparel from the campaign will be worn by Nike athletes during NBA All-Star weekend.

Nike said it is donating $5 million this year to organizations like MENTOR and PeacePlayers, which it says ""advance equality in communities"" across the country.

'Lego Batman' producer today. Treasury secretary tomorrow?,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/media/lego-batman-movie-steven-mnuchin/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Steven Mnuchin had a pretty good weekend.

First the treasury secretary pick advanced a step closer toward confirmation on Friday.

Then his latest movie claimed the top spot at the box office.

Mnuchin is an executive producer on Warner Bros.' ""The Lego Batman Movie,"" which pulled in an estimated $55.6 million from U.S. audiences during its opening weekend.

CNN, like Warner Bros., is owned by Time Warner.

The kid-friendly spinoff of 2014's ""The Lego Movie"" handily beat its raunchy competitor, Universal's ""Fifty Shades Darker.""

The sequel to 2015's ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" based on a best-selling series of romance novels, debuted at $46.8 million in the United States.

Mnuchin is listed as a producer or executive producer on 34 films in recent years, including last summer's ""Suicide Squad,"" which brought in $786 million worldwide.

He also produced ""The Lego Ninjago Movie,"" another Lego franchise spinoff that will hit screens this fall.

Mnuchin is widely expected to be serving as Treasury secretary by then.

Following a 53-46 vote last Friday to break a Democratic filibuster, Mnuchin is scheduled for a final vote before the full Senate at 7 p.m. Monday.

The last thing Europe needs: another Greek crisis,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/08/news/economy/greece-imf-bailout-eurozone/index.html?section=money_news_international,"How's this for déjà vu? Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe.

Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads. Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt.

Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an ""explosive"" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue.

The timing could hardly be worse. European leaders have a lot on their plate. Elections are looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Brexit negotiations will begin within weeks.

Yet the threat of Greece tumbling out of the euro demands attention. Here's why the next few weeks will be key:

Hammer to fall

Greece is running out of cash, but it needs to make repayments to creditors including the European Central Bank. Major bills are coming due in July.

If Greece cannot make the payments, it will default on its debt and spiral out of the eurozone.

Meanwhile, its latest bailout -- the third since 2010 -- is effectively frozen. The negotiating positions of major players are further apart than at any point since the bailout was agreed in June, 2015.

There is even disagreement over the size of the problem facing Greece.

""The IMF's latest review of Greece's debt position was surprisingly pessimistic,"" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of top eurozone finance officials. ""It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes.""

I want it all

The IMF, Greece and creditors led by Germany all have very different priorities. Here's what each wants:

The IMF has called on Greece to make more ambitious changes to its economy, including labor market reforms. The IMF didn't join the third bailout when first agreed in 2015 because it did not view Greece's debt as being sustainable. It still maintains that Greece cannot be self sustaining without major debt relief.

Greece's main creditors agree that Athens should implement the reforms proposed by the IMF. However, they have categorically ruled out any debt relief, a position reiterated by eurozone finance officials on Tuesday.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, shows no sign of yielding to demands for additional reforms. He insists that debt relief is needed before any new concessions are made.

It's a classic standoff and investors are watching to see which party blinks first.

Put out the fire

The next major milestone is a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Feb. 20 -- the last before elections start muddying Europe's political waters. Agreeing yet more financial aid for Greece will become even harder once voters start casting their ballots.

After that, bills will start coming due. Greece faces a payment to the ECB of roughly €1.4 billion in late April and another €4.1 billion in July.

The stake are high.

The unemployment rate in Greece is expected to run above 21% in 2017. Investment is down by more than 60% and output has contracted by more than 25% since the financial crisis. The country's social fabric is fraying.

If European creditors refuse further help, Greece's debt will spiral out of control no matter how quickly its economy grows, according to the IMF.

That will leave only one option -- abandoning the euro.

Ted Malloch, President Trump's expected choice for U.S. ambassador to the EU, told Greek television on Tuesday that the eurozone's future would be decided in the next 18 months.

""Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it's very much a question that is on the agenda,"" he said. ""I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro.""",0.11484759684759688,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150520121818-loosing-on-greece-780x439.jpg,2017,"['déjà vu', 'debt crisis', 'europe', 'greece', 'european creditors', 'release cash', 'debt repayments', 'greek debt', 'adding', 'monetary', 'greece', ""'s debt"", 'european leaders', 'elections', 'netherlands', 'france', 'germany', 'brexit', 'greece', 'euro demands attention', 'hammer', 'greece', 'european central bank', 'major bills', 'july', 'greece', 'major players', 'june', 'greece', 'imf', 'greece', ""'s debt position"", 'jeroen dijsselbloem', 'dutch', 'chairs meetings', 'top eurozone finance officials', 'greece', 'imf', 'greece', 'germany', 'different priorities', 'imf', 'greece', 'ambitious changes', 'labor market reforms', 'imf', 'greece', ""'s debt"", 'greece', 'major debt relief', 'greece', 'main creditors', 'athens', 'imf', 'debt relief', 'eurozone finance officials', 'prime', 'alexis tsipras', 'additional reforms', 'debt relief', 'new concessions', 'classic standoff', 'party blinks', 'major milestone', 'eurozone finance ministers', 'feb.', 'europe', 'political waters', 'agreeing', 'financial aid', 'greece', 'greece', 'ecb', 'april', 'july', 'unemployment rate', 'greece', 'financial crisis', ""country 's"", 'social fabric', 'european creditors refuse', 'greece', ""'s debt"", 'imf', 'ted malloch', 'trump', 'u.s.', 'eu', 'greek television', ""eurozone 's future"", 'europe', 'eurozone survives', 'greece']","[('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('2015', 'DATE'), ('Greek', 'NORP'), ('the International Monetary Fund', 'ORG'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('the Netherlands', 'GPE'), ('France', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Brexit', 'PERSON'), ('weeks', 'DATE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('the next few weeks', 'DATE'), ('Hammer', 'PERSON'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('the European Central Bank', 'ORG'), ('Major', 'ORG'), ('July', 'DATE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('2010', 'DATE'), ('June, 2015', 'DATE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('IMF', 'ORG'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Jeroen Dijsselbloem', 'PERSON'), ('Dutch', 'NORP'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('IMF', 'ORG'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('IMF', 'ORG'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('2015', 'DATE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Athens', 'GPE'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Greek', 'NORP'), ('Alexis Tsipras', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Feb. 20', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('ECB', 'ORG'), ('roughly €1.4 billion', 'MONEY'), ('late April', 'DATE'), ('€4.1 billion', 'MONEY'), ('July', 'DATE'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('above 21%', 'PERCENT'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('more than 60%', 'PERCENT'), ('more than 25%', 'PERCENT'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Greece', 'GPE'), ('only one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Ted Malloch', 'PERSON'), ('Trump', 'PERSON'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('EU', 'ORG'), ('Greek', 'NORP'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('the next 18 months', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Greece', 'GPE')]",Business
Verizon is bringing back unlimited data,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/12/technology/verizon-unlimited-data-plan/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Verizon VZ

Starting Monday, Verizon customers can get unlimited data, talk and text for $80.

The company says the new introductory plan also includes up to 10 GB of mobile hotspot usage, as well as calling and texting to Mexico and Canada. It will also allow customers to stream unlimited HD video, thumbing its nose at T-Mobile's controversial practice of lowering video quality for some of its unlimited data customers.

Although the new Verizon plan promises ""fast LTE speeds,"" those using a lot of data may suffer. The company said that after a customer uses 22 gb of data on a line during any billing cycle, it ""may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion."" That has become standard practice on all networks that offer unlimited data plans.

Related: T-Mobile and Sprint offer new 'unlimited' data plans -- sort of

Verizon first eliminated its version of an unlimited usage plan in 2011, following similar decisions by other major wireless carriers.

But companies have been steadily reviving such plans.

Verizon first overhauled its data-usage plans last summer when it introduced a new ""Safety Mode"" plan. That technically gave customers access to unlimited data, but they were subjected to slow-as-molasses speeds after they went over their allotted data.

AT&T similarly eliminated overage fees for customers in September. Like Verizon, AT&T throttles customers speeds once they reach the data limit on their plans. The company brought back unlimited plans earlier last year, but it is only available for homes with both AT&T's wireless phone service and either DirecTV or U-Verse TV.

Meanwhile, competitors T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) made their own bids to attract customers looking for ""unlimited data"" plans.

Nearly all NYC subways get cell service

Last August, Sprint began offering a plan to give customers unlimited talk, text and high-speed data for $60 for the first line, $40 for the next, and $30 for each additional up to 10.

The T-Mobile plan, announced the same day as Sprint's, charged $70 a month for the first line, the second at $50 and additional lines are only $20, up to eight lines.",0.08262836700336701,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160602130301-best-brand-verizon-780x439.jpg,2017,"['verizon vz', 'verizon', 'new introductory plan', 'gb', 'mobile hotspot usage', 'mexico', 'canada', 'hd', 't-mobile', 'controversial practice', 'video quality', 'data customers', 'verizon', 'lte', 'customer uses', 'billing cycle', 'prioritize usage', 'network congestion', 'standard practice', 'data plans', 'related', 't-mobile', 'sprint', 'data plans', 'verizon', 'usage plan', 'similar decisions', 'major wireless carriers', 'such plans', 'verizon', 'data-usage plans', 'safety mode', 'customers access', 'slow-as-molasses speeds', 'at', 'overage fees', 'september', 'verizon', 'at', 'throttles customers speeds', 'data limit', 'at', ""'s wireless phone service"", 'directv', 'u-verse', 't-mobile', 'tmus', 'sprint', 'own bids', 'nyc', 'cell service', 'august', 'sprint', 't-mobile', 'sprint', 'additional lines']","[('Verizon', 'GPE'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Verizon', 'GPE'), ('80', 'MONEY'), ('GB', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Canada', 'GPE'), ('Verizon', 'ORG'), ('LTE', 'PERSON'), ('22', 'CARDINAL'), ('Sprint', 'ORG'), ('Verizon', 'LOC'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('2011', 'DATE'), ('Verizon', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('last summer', 'DATE'), ('Safety Mode', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('AT&T', 'ORG'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('Verizon', 'ORG'), ('AT&T', 'ORG'), ('earlier last year', 'DATE'), ('AT&T', 'ORG'), ('U-Verse TV', 'ORG'), ('TMUS', 'ORG'), ('Sprint', 'ORG'), ('NYC', 'ORG'), ('Last August', 'DATE'), ('Sprint', 'ORG'), ('60', 'MONEY'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('30', 'MONEY'), ('up to 10', 'CARDINAL'), ('the same day', 'DATE'), ('Sprint', 'ORG'), ('70', 'MONEY'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('50', 'MONEY'), ('only $20', 'MONEY'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL')]",Business
Visa crackdown puts these rural doctors at risk,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/news/economy/visa-ban-rural-doctor-shortage/index.html?section=money_news_international,"At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Dr. Alaa Al Nofal sees up to 10 patients a day. He's known some of them since they were born. Others, he still treats after they've graduated from high school.

""I treat these children for Type 1 diabetes, thyroid problems, thyroid cancer, puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases,"" he said.

Al Nofal's expertise is critical. He is one of just five full-time pediatric endocrinologists in a 150,000 square-mile area that covers both South and North Dakota.

Like most of rural America, it's a region plagued by a shortage of doctors.

""We're very lucky to have Dr. Al Nofal here. We can't afford to lose someone with his specialization,"" said Cindy Morrison, chief marketing officer for Sanford Health, a non-profit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs 300 hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities.

Related: Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse

Yet, Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network.

A Syrian citizen, Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad 30 visa waiver -- which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J-1 exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa. The Conrad 30 waiver allows him to stay in the U.S. for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage.

After President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- including Syria -- from entering the U.S., Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America.

""We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country, but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America,"" said Al Nofal. ""They may no longer want to practice in the United States."" The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban.

Related: Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban

Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities.

Sanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order. ""If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families,"" said Sanford Health's Morrison.

And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too. The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S.

More than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas. About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place.

The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of ""national interest,"" but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration.

""The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas,"" said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.

Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa. He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls.

Nineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average.

He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment. Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away.

""It's not easy being a doctor in this setting,"" said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters. ""But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it.""

It's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban.

""I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now. My family in Syria can't come here,"" he said. ""Now my family can't meet their first grandson.""

""I know if we leave I probably can never come back,"" he said. Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now. ""I'm afraid of how I will be treated,"" he said. He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state.

Almatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July.

Everything was going smoothly. Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted. He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer.

But there was one last step. For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

""The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department,"" he said.

Because he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome.

""The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors. Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me,"" he said.

""No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy,"" he said. ""Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability.""",0.014795075054815313,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170210105854-dr-nofal-patient-780x439.jpg,2017,"['pediatrics practice', 'dakota', 'alaa al nofal', 'high school', 'type',

Trump isn't killing the bull market. Here's why,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/investing/stocks-united-states-trump-europe-china-japan/index.html?section=money_news_international,"More and more business leaders and Wall Street strategists are expressing their worries about what President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and unpredictable nature might do to the markets and economy.

But we all know that action speaks louder than words. What investors are actually doing is in stark contrast to what people are saying. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs again on Friday.

And the Russell 2000, an index of small company stocks that tend to do most of their business in the U.S., is now just a few points away from the all-time high it hit last December in the wake of Trump market euphoria.

What's more, the VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is down nearly 25% this year as well. If investors were really scared of Trump, the VIX should be much higher.

And CNNMoney's own Fear & Greed Index, which looks at the VIX and six other measures of investor sentiment, is showing signs of Greed and is not far from Extreme Greed levels.

Of course, Trump still can't seem to help himself from tweeting about things that, let's be honest, won't do anything to help the economy -- although Nordstrom investors are richer despite Trump attacking them for dumping his daughter Ivanka's brand.

But to give credit where it's due, it looks like the main reason that stocks have taken off again lately is because Trump has promised to unveil a ""phenomenal"" tax plan soon.

Trump also pledged again to invest more on infrastructure when he met with airline CEOs on Thursday.

That's what the market wants to hear.

""We still expect fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and less regulation,"" said Matt Lockridge, manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value Fund. ""The timing is the big question, but it's coming.""

Lockridge thinks that many companies that generate a majority of their revenues from America should benefit if Trump stimulus winds up kicking the economy into a higher gear.

He likes stocks in a variety of industries, such as movie theater owner Masco (MAS), snack food firm J & J (JJSF) and aerospace equipment company Kaman (KAMN).

Another money manager said he's also still bullish on small U.S. stocks that could get a lift from Trump policies.

Barry James, president and CEO of James Investment Research, said he bought the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) the day after the election because he's confident Trump's stimulus plan will boost growth for U.S small businesses.

""When Trump said America first, I really think that's what he means,"" James said, adding that he thinks Internet phone service Vonage (VG), rent-to-own retailer Aaron's (AAN) and discount chain Big Lots (BIG) could all thrive if Trump's proposals go through.

But there's another reason why the U.S. markets are near all-time highs. Despite all of the uncertainty in Washington, the U.S. is still viewed as a paragon of relative stability compared to other parts of the world.

Europe's economy is still a big wild card thanks to Brexit, the rise of populism in France leading to worries about a so-called Frexit and more worries about the problem that never seems to go away -- Greece's debt woes.

Japan's economy remains stagnant as well. We're talking about more than just a lost decade now. It's plural. And China's economy is slowing down too.

Bond fund manager Bill Gross has often joked that America is like what Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson sang about in ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" -- the ""cleanest dirty shirt.""

To that end, analysts at bond rating firm Fitch wrote in a report Friday that ""elements of President Trump's economic agenda would be positive for growth,"" but added that ""the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome.""

Of course, there are two sides to that coin. Trump's bombast could come back to haunt him.

His continued penchant for reprimanding companies that he disagrees with on Twitter could dent investor confidence.

And while his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries has been overturned by the U.S. court system for now, the president has vowed to fight for its reinstatement.

Even if he loses that battle, it's still clear that Trump is serious on turning more inward, with plans for tariffs and border-adjusted taxes that could ignite trade wars with Mexico, China and Japan. That could hurt big U.S. multinational firms and lead to job cuts.

But investors still seem to believe/hope that the merits of Trump's pro-growth stimulus plans and tax cuts will outweigh the impact of isolationism. Let's hope they're right.

Investors may be holding their noses, closing their eyes and stuffing cotton in their ears to drown out the president.
